<strong>Project Director Dr. Jonathan J. Bonk</strong> is Research Professor of Mission at Boston University, where he directs the <em>Dictionary of African Christian Biography</em>, an electronic, multilingual, non-proprietary reference tool <a href="http://www.dacb.org">www.DACB.org</a> that he founded in 1995, and which has served as a stimulus for similar undertakings in Latin America, China, Singapore, and India. He served as Chair and Professor of Global Christian Studies at Providence University College and Theological Seminary in Manitoba, and as Adjunct Professor of Evangelism and Mission at both Yale Divinity School in New Haven and Presbyterian College and Seminary in Seoul. He is Executive Director Emeritus of the Overseas Ministries Study Center in New Haven, Connecticut <a href="http://www.omsc.org">www.OMSC.org</a> where he served as Director from 1997 until his retirement in July 2013. He was Editor of the <a href="http://www.internationalbulletin.org">International Bulletin of Missionary Research</a> from July 1997 until June 2013. He received all of his primary education and part of his high school in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia, where his missionary parents served as builders of schools and hospitals until their retirement. He served as famine relief coordinator for Tigre Province in northern Ethiopia from 1974-1976. His adoptive family draws him back to Ethiopia regularly to visit the relatives of his adopted children. His MA project from Trinity Divinity School was “An Annotated and Classified Bibliography of English Literature Pertaining to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.” His PhD from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland focused on the theory and practice of missionary identification during the high Imperial era (1860-1910), with special reference to Central Africa and Central China. In 2013, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity by Berkeley Divinity School at Yale for his contribution to the study and understanding of world Christianity. He has served as President of several academic associations, including the American Society of Missiology (ASM), the Association of Professors of Mission (APM), and the International Association for Mission Studies (IAMS). He has served on the editorial board of the Oxford Studies in World Christianity series since 2006, and is current President of the [Korean] Global Mission Leadership Forum. In 2005, in collaboration with Yale Divinity School Library, he spearheaded the online database “Researching World Christianity: Doctoral Dissertations on Mission Since 1900.” In 1995, in addition to founding the <em>Dictionary of African Christian Biography</em>, he created an electronic index for his Ida Grace McRuer Missions Resource Centre’s collection of mission-related serials, a collection that was relocated to the University of Edinburgh in 1997, and then to Liverpool Hope University in 2008 where it is now part of the Andrew F. Walls Centre for the Study of Christianity in Africa and Asia. He has published five books, more than one hundred scholarly articles and book chapters, numerous reviews and editorials, and is the editor of seven collaborative volumes. His best-known book is <em>Missions and Money: Affluence as a Western Missionary Problem (Orbis: 1st edition 1991, 13 printings; 2nd edition 2007, 3 printings), translated into Korean and Burmese. He is editor of the Encyclopedia of Missions and Missionaries, Volume 9 in Routledge’s Religion and Society Series (2007).  He and his wife, Jean, are active members of the Fort Garry Mennonite Fellowship in Winnipeg. During the 49 years of their marriage, their home has become home to a number of refugees, “illegal” immigrants, needy young adults, and a number of children and other folks who have needed a temporary or longer term place to call “home.” The net result today is a family on a modest traditional Mennonite scale, with “relatives” everywhere. He lectures part time at the Canadian Mennonite University in Winnipeg, and is an active member of his church’s Refugee Welcoming Committee, now serving a recently-arrived family of five from Syria.
