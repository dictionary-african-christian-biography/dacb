&lt;p&gt;For several centuries the Protestant movement was based in Europe, and then North America. In 2017 there are 560 million Protestants found in nearly all the world’s 234 countries. Of these 560 million, only 16% are in Europe, but 41% are in Africa. We anticipate by 2050, 53% of all Protestants will live in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

Approximately sixty scholars and graduate students converged on the School of Theology from Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ghana, Great Britain, and various universities in the United States and Canada to present papers and discuss issues on the theme of African Christian Biography. As an intersection between scholars in religious studies and African studies, the conference was a venue for cross-fertilization between the various fields represented. Furthermore, it was an opportunity to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Dictionary of African Christian Biography (DACB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/confer-reception.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Conference-Panel&quot; class=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt;In the opening plenary, DACB Project Director Jonathan Bonk presented a brief historical overview by looking at the “What?, the Why?, the How?, and the Now What?” of the project. In the Friday morning plenary address, Prof. Lamin Sanneh of Yale University focused his talk on Sir Samuel Lewis whose extraordinary life illustrated the power of human example in the service of religion and society in 19th century West Africa. The afternoon plenary panel with noted scholars Kathleen Sheldon, Richard Elphick, and Diana Wylie addressed, among other questions, the challenge of the portrayal of belief in biography as well as the various uses of biography in historical writing. The dinner plenary by Boston University professor Linda Heywood offered an opportunity to explore the life of a notable 17th century Kongo figure, Queen Njinga.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the concurrent sessions, questions raised either in the papers or in the subsequent discussion included the role of biography in pedagogy, orality and memory in biography, the use of photography and film in biography, and the use of biography for highlighting the stories of women the Global South. Almost a third of the papers examined the stories of African women, exploring their roles as helpers and leaders, most often unrecognized in the historical record. The discussions also looked at the role of biographers as portrait artists who must paint their subjects with humility and empathy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/news/confer-dinner.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Conference-Dinner&quot; class=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt;In the closing session, the progress of the DACB was praised and many participants offered ideas and challenges for new developments in the future. Conference organizer Dana Robert offered a few words about the book that will be published as a fruit of the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

Keynote Speaker: Professor Lamin Sanneh, Yale University. Hosts: Professors Dana L. Robert, Jonathan Bonk, and M.L. Daneel, Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The writing of biography has become a major form of documentation for the growing world Christian movement. The purpose of this conference is to reflect upon the progress made by the first twenty years of the &lt;em&gt;Dictionary of African Christian Biography&lt;/em&gt;, the award-winning web-based documentation project founded in 1995, and to identify new directions in the use of biography and autobiography for the study of African Christianity. The goal of the conference is to produce an edited volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those giving papers, travel and participation will be subsidized by the Center for Global Christianity and Mission at the Boston University School of Theology. The African Studies Library at Boston University will host a reception and special exhibits on the scholarship of African Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Requested paper topics include the following:&lt;br /&gt;
•	Narrative as history in the documentation of African Christianity&lt;br /&gt;
•	Biographies of African Christians&lt;br /&gt;
•	Multiple religious belonging in African church history&lt;br /&gt;
•	Women, gender, and the growth of African Christianity&lt;br /&gt;
•	Political and social dimensions of African Christian biography&lt;br /&gt;
•	Autobiography as history: possibilities and limitations&lt;br /&gt;
•	Hagiography as a tool for understanding African society, culture, and theology&lt;br /&gt;
•	Biographical research and writing: cultural and legal constraints on the research, use and interpretation of biography&lt;br /&gt;
•	African biography in World Christianity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The main template now has new colors and a slightly modified design. The homepage has received a complete makeover in the interest of offering a more user-friendly experience to our readers. In order to highlight the many resources of the DACB, the new homepage now offers links to featured themes and articles on the Web site. In addition, the “Research Resources” box links to outside Web sites that can be of use to scholars of African Christianity (this includes missions and global Christianity as well). The content of these various boxes rotates on a weekly, semi-weekly, or monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently added a new page for &lt;a href=&quot;/contribute/readers/&quot;&gt;Readers’ Comments&lt;/a&gt;. We welcome your feedback and your anecdotes or memories about people in the DACB. We share a selection of this feedback from our readers on this page. Please write us at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dacb@bu.edu&quot;&gt;dacb@bu.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More significant are the changes in the administrative structure of the DACB. There is now an &lt;a href=&quot;/about/editorial-committee/&quot;&gt;Editorial Committee&lt;/a&gt; that meets bi-annually for planning and a new &lt;a href=&quot;/about/advisors/&quot;&gt;Advisory Council&lt;/a&gt;, composed of prominent African leaders either in academic institutions or in regional and continent-wide organizations related to the church and to theological education.

During this time, the physical home of the online database was transferred from the Overseas Ministries Study Center (OMSC) to the Center for Global Christianity and Mission (CGCM) directed by Dr. Dana Robert at Boston University School of Theology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the transfer, Michèle Sigg entered the doctoral program in World Christianity and Christian Mission, starting in the fall of 2012. Since then she has continued in her role as project manager but on a part-time basis, in addition to her studies. Moreover, DACB Project Director Jonathan Bonk retired from his position as Executive Director of OMSC in June of 2013. He will, however, continue in his role as project director of the DACB for the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The academic year 2013-2014 is another year of planning and transformation for the DACB in the wake of this transition to a new location in a major research university deeply engaged in the study of Christianity in the Global South. During this year, the executive committee of the DACB, composed of Dr. Jonathan Bonk (project director), Dr. Dana Robert (CGCM director), and Michèle Sigg (project manager) will be charting the way forward in dialogue with our partners for the next chapter of the DACB’s mission to document the history of African Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The academic year 2011-2012, during which Project Manager Michèle Sigg networked for the DACB while studying at Africa International University (formerly NEGST) in Nairobi, Kenya, represented a year of transition for the Dictionary.
