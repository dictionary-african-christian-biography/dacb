&lt;p&gt;We lament the departure from this life on January 6 of our beloved Professor Lamin Sanneh. In addition to being a close personal friend, he was a staunch supporter and advocate of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.DACB.org&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dictionary of African Christian Biography&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Since 1995, when the DACB began to show signs of becoming more than just an idea, he steadily supported the venture by word and by deed, as a consultant, supporter, advisory council member, and as a member of the Executive Committee. He will be sorely missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are therefore pleased to announce two new members who will be joining the Executive Committee effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/editorial-committee/jmugambi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mugambi&quot; class=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt;
Professor Dr. Jesse N. K. Mugambi (PhD, FKNAS, EBS), from Kenya, has been an active and effective member of the Africa Advisory Council since 2014. He is Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, University of Nairobi, from which he graduated with his BA, MA and PhD.  Prof. Mugambi is a committed churchman (Anglican), an exemplary ecumenist and networker, and an extraordinarily productive academic whose interests, ranging across disciplinary lines, have resulted in many noteworthy publications, among which are: &lt;em&gt;Christianity and the African Cultural Heritage&lt;/em&gt; (2005); “Climate Change and Food Security: A Challenge for African Christianity” and “Profile of African Christianity at Home and in the West” in &lt;em&gt;Anthology of African Christianity&lt;/em&gt; (Regnum 2017); &lt;em&gt;African Theology of Reconstruction&lt;/em&gt; (Butare 2016);  “The Future of Theological Education in Africa and the Challenges it Faces” and  “Challenges for Theological Publishing of Scholarly books in Africa” in &lt;em&gt;Handbook of Theological Education in Africa&lt;/em&gt; (Regnum; 2013); &lt;em&gt;Christianity and African Culture&lt;/em&gt; (Acton 1989, 2000, 2002); &lt;em&gt;Contextual Theology Across Cultures&lt;/em&gt; (Acton 2009, with Michael R. Guy). His global travels, extensive consulting, and established contacts with colleagues in institutions across Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe have proven greatly beneficial to the DACB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/editorial-committee/wariboko-nimi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wariboko&quot; class=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt;
Professor Dr. Nimi Wariboko is the Walter G. Muelder Professor of Social Ethics at Boston University School of Theology. He holds a PhD in Ethics (Suma Cum Laude) from Princeton Theological Seminary, an MBA in Finance and Accounting from Columbia University in New York City, and a B.Sc. (Economics, first class honors) from University of Port Harcourt, Nigeria. An extraordinarily creative and productive academic, both the originality and range of Dr. Nimi Wariboko’s scholarship is attested by his numerous publications in the fields of economic ethics, Christian social ethics, African social traditions, Pentecostal studies, and philosophical theology. Five of his many books are representative of his scholarly energy, originality, and range: &lt;em&gt;The Principle of Excellence: A Framework for Social Ethics&lt;/em&gt; (Lexington 2009);  &lt;em&gt;God and Money: A Theology of Money in a Globalizing World&lt;/em&gt; (Lexington 1955);  &lt;em&gt;Ethics and Time: Ethos of Temporal Orientation in Politics and Religion of the Niger Delta&lt;/em&gt; (Lexington 2010);  &lt;em&gt;The Pentecostal Principle: Ethical Methodology in New Spirit&lt;/em&gt; (Eerdmans 2012); and  &lt;em&gt;Economics in Spirit and Truth: A Moral Philosophy of Finance&lt;/em&gt; (Palgrave Macmillan 2014). He has followed with interest the development of the DACB, and looks forward to working with us to ensure the ongoing viability, credibility, functionality, and dissemination of the resource.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">News Release: Members added to the Executive Committee</summary></entry><entry xml:lang="en"><title type="html">DACB to Collaborate with Jesuit Historical Institute In Africa</title><link href="/JHIA-newpartner/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="DACB to Collaborate with Jesuit Historical Institute In Africa" /><published>2019-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-01-30T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/JHIA-newpartner</id><content type="html" xml:base="/JHIA-newpartner/">![JHIA logo](/images/news/jhia-logo.jpg){:class=&quot;bio&quot;}
**The Jesuit Historical Institute in Africa (JHIA)**

The Jesuit Historical Institute in Africa (JHIA), located in Nairobi, Kenya, is an institute dedicated to preserving memory and promoting knowledge in Africa and its adjacent islands.  

JHIA started in 2010 as an idea of the Jesuit General, Adolfo Nicholás, S.J., to encourage the study of his Order's largely unexplored involvement in the evangelization of Africa. Further deliberations pointed to the need for such a study to be carried out within a broader social, political, cultural and religious context. The JHIA's vision was thus expanded to that of offering a cost-effective environment for ground-breaking research on the religious histories, cultures and traditions of the people of Africa and Madagascar.

It is with great sadness that we announce the death of Professor Lamin Sanneh on January 6, 2019.  
Sanneh served on the charter Advisory Council of the DACB that began in 1995 and, in recent years, he was a member of the Editorial Committee. When I received the news of his death Monday morning, I was overwhelmed with a terrible feeling of loss. The article I was editing was full of references to his work. His name appears on many pages of the DACB website. The sight of his name on the spines of the books surrounding me suddenly brought a sense of grief that remains with me. I will always remember his guidance, wisdom, and encouragement in my work for the DACB. The community of scholars in Africa and the West will feel the loss of his light for years to come.   
Below are a few tributes in his memory from DACB Editors and Advisors.

**Jonathan Bonk, director of the *Dictionary of African Christian Biography*, Center for Global Christianity and Mission at Boston University**:

I first met Lamin in 1979 at the University of Aberdeen, where I was studying under Andrew Walls. Lamin, recently graduated from the School of African and Oriental Studies (SOAS) at London University with a PhD in Islamic History, had been recruited by Walls to fill a gap in the Department of Religious Studies. To Lamin’s surprise, a year after arriving he was “invited” to teach the required seminar on Christianity as a World Religion. He was too polite to decline … and the rest is history.

He was gripped by the phenomenon of contemporary Christianity as a primarily non-Western religion. He became one of the best informed and most trusted interpreters of world Christianity and Islam of his generation. As comfortable with some of Islam’s most gifted intellectuals as he was with Christians in the upper echelons of ecclesiology and academia, his deeply informed understanding of and appreciate for both faiths combined with his modesty and his eloquence to make him a unique and much sought after voice in an era more characterized by reductionist polarizations than by deep understanding.

A committed Christian, Lamin understood and appreciated his Muslim roots. His last major book—*Beyond Jihad: The Pacifist Tradition in West African Islam* (OUP 2016)—had, he told me over Turkish lunch, left him intellectually and physically exhausted. It was, he thought, his magnum opus, and he doubted that he would attempt another one.

Physically, he was an imposing figure; intellectually, he was even more impressive. These qualities were combined with deep personal modesty and a willingness to listen carefully to what others had to say. One of my favorite experiences for many years was his summation at the end of each annual Yale-Edinburgh Group on the History of Missionary Movement and World Christianity meeting, now anticipating its 29th year.

Lamin was fond of pointing out that those who gathered were simply a group of friends from around the world who shared a common academic interest and who gathered alternative years at the University of Edinburgh and Yale University to read papers, discuss issues, share points-of-view, and encourage each other. At the end of these two and a half day marathons--in which Lamin inevitably sat in the front row deep in thought, with his eyes closed--he would provide an eloquent verbatim summary of the event, respectfully referencing every presentation and its author, knitting the disparate pieces together into a picture that was better than we knew!

And now my good friend is home at last—summoned from the margins to the Center. He is sorely missed.

**Dana L. Robert, director of the Center for Global Christianity and Mission at Boston University School of Theology; Editorial Committee, *Dictionary of African Christian Biography***:

Professor Lamin Sanneh was a giant in the field of World Christianity. His loss sends a tidal wave across multiple fields, institutions, and continents. He will be sorely missed by those of us who worked with him and called him friend, as well as by people who knew him only from his powerful writings.

As an African, a superb scholar, and a convert from Islam, Lamin Sanneh saw from the outside what those raised on the inside could not. His 1989 book *Translating the Message* showed how the gospel could become part of every culture, through being translated into the language and worldview of the people. He challenged the assumption that Christianity was merely a tool of western colonizers.

Through his founding of the annual Yale-Edinburgh conferences on mission history, his publications, his editorship of the Oxford University Press World Christianity Series, his leadership of the *Dictionary of African Christian Biography*, and many other important projects, Lamin Sanneh collaborated with others to transform the study of mission history, African religions, and World Christianity.

What a tragedy!  I have received the news of the passing of Prof Sanneh with great shock and sadness! I have no words to say to his family, colleagues and friends. His passing is a great loss to the African academic fraternity and globally. I had the privilege to meet him severally in New Haven and at the conference on African Christian Biography sometimes back in Boston. He will always be remembered because of his ground breaking work on African Christianity. May the Lord comfort his family and give them the strength to bear this great loss. Fare thee well Prof. Sanneh.

**Jesse Mugambi,  Ecumenist; World Council of Churches; Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, University of Nairobi, Kenya; DACB Advisory Council member**

Lamin Sanneh [was] one of the most admirable role-models for African Academia—-both within our continent and among the African diaspora in Europe and North America. His death has come only a few months after that of Professor James H. Cone on 28th April 2018. As we mourn these great scholars, the greatest and most worthwhile tributes with which to honor them, will be our own endeavor to emulate them— each of us in our respective specializations and vocations, especially the published works of Lamin Sanneh and James H. Cone.

**Esther E. Acolatse, associate professor of pastoral theology and intercultural studies at Knox College at the University of Toronto; DACB Advisory Council member**:

I’m overwhelmed with sadness even as I recall fond memories of Professor Lamin Sanneh … This past year has been enriched by his astute mind and generosity to a younger colleague. I was pleasantly surprised by his thoughtful engagement of my work in a foreword to my latest book and an extended conversation with him in April as well as November where it was clear he still had a lot to contribute to the shaping of the field of global Christianity and its tenor.

He shared a couple of devotions he had authored for *The Christian Century* in 1989 and suggested that we could write and make such devotions available to the African Church and beyond. Those devotions coupled with his vast academic writing brought me face to face with the mind and spiritual life behind it.

When I asked how he found time to write so much. He simply said: &quot;Because I’m afraid one day I’ll be asked by God to give account of how I have used my time. I want to be able to bear up under that question.&quot;&quot; Just less than a month ago, we communicated as he waited to board a plane from Accra, and his hopes for my involvement with the new center just named for him. Now, labor over, he joins the church triumphant. His works and the many lives he has touched will continue to bear testimony to a life faithfully lived.

**Cluster Publications** of South Africa has just released *African Christian Biography*, edited by Dana L. Robert, a volume of the proceedings of the African Christian Biography Conference held at Boston University in October 2015.

**About this book**:
The papers in this volume narrate the histories of leading African Christians, and reflect on the meaning of writing African Christian biographies. Written to celebrate the *Dictionary of African Christian Biography* (www.dacb.org), this volume shows why remembering the lives of Christian leaders remains important for understanding African history, Christian identities, and African contributions to the shaping of World Christianity. The authors include some of the world’s leading scholars of African Christianity in its social, political, and theological contexts. Subjects of the papers range from an Ethiopian saint, to kings and queens, history making Protestant pastors, and women whose hidden stories undergird their transformative
leadership of family, church and society.

Approximately sixty scholars and graduate students converged on the School of Theology from Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Ghana, Great Britain, and various universities in the United States and Canada to present papers and discuss issues on the theme of African Christian Biography. As an intersection between scholars in religious studies and African studies, the conference was a venue for cross-fertilization between the various fields represented. Furthermore, it was an opportunity to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the Dictionary of African Christian Biography (DACB).

![Conference-Panel](/images/news/confer-reception.jpg){:class=&quot;bio&quot;}In the opening plenary, DACB Project Director Jonathan Bonk presented a brief historical overview by looking at the “What?, the Why?, the How?, and the Now What?” of the project. In the Friday morning plenary address, Prof. Lamin Sanneh of Yale University focused his talk on Sir Samuel Lewis whose extraordinary life illustrated the power of human example in the service of religion and society in 19th century West Africa. The afternoon plenary panel with noted scholars Kathleen Sheldon, Richard Elphick, and Diana Wylie addressed, among other questions, the challenge of the portrayal of belief in biography as well as the various uses of biography in historical writing. The dinner plenary by Boston University professor Linda Heywood offered an opportunity to explore the life of a notable 17th century Kongo figure, Queen Njinga.

In the concurrent sessions, questions raised either in the papers or in the subsequent discussion included the role of biography in pedagogy, orality and memory in biography, the use of photography and film in biography, and the use of biography for highlighting the stories of women the Global South. Almost a third of the papers examined the stories of African women, exploring their roles as helpers and leaders, most often unrecognized in the historical record. The discussions also looked at the role of biographers as portrait artists who must paint their subjects with humility and empathy.

![Conference-Dinner](/images/news/confer-dinner.jpg){:class=&quot;bio&quot;}In the closing session, the progress of the DACB was praised and many participants offered ideas and challenges for new developments in the future. Conference organizer Dana Robert offered a few words about the book that will be published as a fruit of the conference.
