### DACB People

**[Editorial Comittee](http://www.dacb.org/jonbio.htm)**  
The _DACB_ is facilitated by a very small administrative staff. You can read more about them and their roles [**here**](http://www.dacb.org/jonbio.htm).

**[Advisors](http://www.dacb.org/jonbio.htm)**  
Meet the new Advisory Council [**members**](http://localhost/dacb/project/advisors).

**Project Luke Scholars**  
The heart of the project lies in Africa where the stories of African Christians can be found. From 1999 to 2011, the _DACB_ offered two scholarships per year to African writers--scholars and lay people, men and women--so they could spend a year in residency in the United States to write the stories of ten significant African Christians for the _DACB_. You can meet our Project Luke scholars [**here][3]** and read about the Project Luke scholarship [**here][4]**.

**Authors**  
In addition, many individuals, both Africans and Westerners, have contributed biographies to the _DACB_. You can find a list of our DACB authors [**here][5]**.

**Participating Institutions**  
Religious institutions and university departments throughout Africa have contributed stories to the _DACB_. They have offered training and encouraged their students to write biographies for the _DACB_. You can find a list of these institutions and their biographies [**here,][6]** a detailed list of the stories they have provided [**here][7]**, and contact information for any institutions interested in collaborating with us in the past [here][8].

**Partners**  
Of course, the _DACB_ would not exist without the support of our [**partners][9]**.

**Administrative Summary**   
This [**document**][10] describes how the various groups of people listed above interact in the overall project.
