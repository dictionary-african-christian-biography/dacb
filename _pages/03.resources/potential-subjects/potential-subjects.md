The following indexes contain potential DACB subjects, both Africans and missionaries, listed here for reference, to inform and encourage future research.  

**How to use these pages:**  

1\. Consult these pages if you wish to write a biography for the DACB and are searching for ideas of people whose biographies do not yet appear in the DACB. If a name is listed and does not show a link in the column next to the name, then the DACB doesn't have a biography on that person. Subjects with ENG, FR, POR or SWA in the links columns have biographies in those languages that you can access on the DACB site. Return to the country page to view the story.   

2\. Consult these pages in order to avoid writing a duplicate biography by checking to see whether the DACB has a biography on a specific person.
