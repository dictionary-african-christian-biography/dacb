**Received February 20, 2014, from Sophie Imasiku (Zambia):**

I was born and grew up here in Zambia at a place called Mambilima in the Luapula province of Zambia. This morning, I took an internet search for our former missionaries who opened up our area for Christianity known as the Open Brethren (Christian Missions in Many Lands). I came across our well-known missionary there by the name of [William Lammond](stories/zambia/lammond_william.html) (1876 to 1968). The entire fraternity there knew him by the name of "Bwana Lamya" because he brought "electricity" to the area which is still there until this day. We are lucky that our place is on the banks of the Luapula river and particularly that the "Mambilima" is the local name for the rapids, meaning " the jumping of the waters. It was formerly called, as you may be aware, "Johnstone Falls" for a number of years from about the early 1920s until my country Zambia attained independence on 24th October 1964\. We are actually celebrating 50 years of our independence this year.  

My late father--May his Soul rest in peace--was a teacher at the same place and we all grew up and got educated in the same CMML faith.  

As a young girl, I knew a lot about Bwana Lammond,especially his 3rd wife Betty Shepherd and her sister who worked as teachers there at Johnston Falls primary School. Most of the people who were and some who are still in the present government here were educated there at the famous Johnstone Falls primary School run by the CMML brethren. they did a lot to develop the area and they built a big hospital which has now modern facilities like a theatre and mortunary, a school for the blind, as the area is known for blind children and also a school for the ![](/buttonimages/sophie-imasiku.jpg)handicapped children. I give great credit to these pioneers for bringing not only christianity but enormous literacy to that impoverished area.  

I am now a grown up woman with three grown up children. I work here at the Zambian Open University as Administrative Assistant to the Bursar, here in the capital city of Lusaka.  

My sincere thanks to D.A.C.B for their remarkable input.
