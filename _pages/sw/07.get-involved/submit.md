In the essential task of documenting the story of African Christianity before it is lost to human memory, the DACB is committed to collecting and preserving: 1) the biographies of African men and women, both lay people and clergy, who have played a significant role in the birth and growth of Christianity over the entire continent, from the time of Jesus to the present and 2) the histories of religious movements, churches, and Christian communities.  

Please follow these guidelines when submitting [biographies](guidelines-writers.html#rwguidelines-bio) and [Christian histories](guidelines-writers.html#rwguidelines-hist). In composing your article, refer to the guidelines for formatting and content found in our [_Instructional Manual (PDF file)_](FinalInstrManual.pdf).

### A. Biographies

</a>

<center>

## Choice of Biographical Subjects

</center>

As you choose biographical subjects for your research, please take into account the following guidelines:  

1\. Subjects whose stories already appear in the _DACB_ will normally not be considered, unless the proposed article gives significant new material and insight. Therefore it is important to consult the _DACB_ either online or at a _DACB_ participating institution, to ascertain whether or not the _DACB_ already has stories on your proposed subjects.  
2. Your subjects need not be confined to professional clerics, missionaries, or theologians, but might include laypersons from various walks of life whose stories are essential to an understanding of the church in Africa.  
3. General suggested length: no longer than 3,000 words and no shorter than 500 words.  
4\. As the intent and purpose of the _DACB_ is to record the history of African Christianity, we ask that you focus on writing the stories of **deceased** subjects.  
5\. It is the policy of _DACB_ **NOT** to publish the stories of living subjects. In very few cases, exceptions have been made if the subjects are (a) of a very venerable age (over 70) and (b) they have retired from all active ministry (in other words, their story is complete). Stories of living subjects will be kept on file in the _DACB_ office for future use.
