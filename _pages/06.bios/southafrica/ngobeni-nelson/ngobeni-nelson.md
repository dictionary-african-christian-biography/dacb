Rev. Nelson Ngobeni was born at Greenvalley in the lowveld of southeastern Northern Province. He met the Church of the Nazarene when he was about ten. One Sunday in about 1921 Rev. Sibhaha (Harmon Schmelzenbach) from Swaziland, riding a white horse, visited the home of his father, Mr. Johane Ngobeni. Many were drunk but Nelson determined to serve God before sunset that day. After that the sunset continually reminded him of his promise.

His parents worshipped the ancestors and as a boy he herded cattle and goats. He disliked the fighting that went on among the herdboys. His father told him he would go mad if he went to Sunday School but he decided that it was ancestral worship that brought madness to people. One day he truly repented and began to witness for the Lord.

In 1922 Ngobeni went away to Johannesburg to work and totally drifted away from the Lord although he remained a church member. But God followed him. One evening he arrived at the railway station in Pretoria at about 7:00 and was gripped by great spiritual darkness. He was so troubled that he went out under a tree and prayed until 10:00 p.m. He surrendered to Jesus and left with great joy. He said, "God really cleansed me."[1]   In 1952 he felt God calling him to the ministry. The problem was that he was making good money working and there was little remuneration in the ministry. However he felt a great burden for his people who did not know God.

While at Vlakfontein, Pretoria, Ngobeni was part of a Nazarene congregation that was just beginning. Mr. Philemon Khoza was a new member that had come to them from the Swiss Mission nine months earlier. He was a hard worker in the church and his great ministry was faithful visitation evangelism. People would tell about his warnings to them against sin and especially the evil of drunkenness.

On Sunday morning, 20th November 1960, he arrived early at the building where they worshipped. He opened it and swept it before Sunday School started. At the close of the worship service he prayed a wonderful prayer touching on the return of Jesus and the resurrection. People stayed on and were reluctant to leave. Khoza then went home with Ngobeni who said it was evident that he was feeling depressed. Khoza told them of his plan to enroll in Bible College in 1962, but he said, "I do not wish to minister here where people understand the gospel. I wish to preach at my home."

Finally at 3:00 p.m. he went out to visit. He was given tea at a certain home and apparently it was poisoned. Upon leaving there he fell alongside the road. Someone found him and took him to hospital where he passed away at 8:00 that evening. Visitation evangelism had cost him his life but he went to his rest in the Lord. It was great loss to the little congregation.[2]

Nelson Ngobeni surrendered to God's call and enrolled at Swaziland Bible College in 1961. He and his wife, Lucy (1921-), pastored at Jabavu (Soweto) and then for eight years at Saulsville, Pretoria. Some young men in his church were called to the ministry. After that the Ngobenis continued to minister successfully in the Eastern District and upon retirement settled at Thulamahashe.[3]

God used Rev. Nelson Ngobeni greatly in evangelistic campaigns and so it was that during the 1970s he came to visit at Mogogela near Hammanskraal (north of Pretoria). In one of the services that week he likened the cleansing of the Holy Spirit in a Christian's heart to the arrival of a deadly black mamba to take over a hole in an anthill. When the mamba appears all of the mice flee.

His son, Rev. Wassenaar Ngobeni became a pastor, principal of a school, then a district superintendent.  In 1999 he accepted the position of Jesus Film Programme Coordinator for the Africa South Field.
