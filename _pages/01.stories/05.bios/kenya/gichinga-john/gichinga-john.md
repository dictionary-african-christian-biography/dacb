John Gichinga is the senior pastor of Nairobi Baptist Church. He has served as General Secretary for the Fellowship of Christian Unions (FOCUS) and has published numerous articles.

John Gichinga was born in 1949 in Gatundu, now in Thika District, the 10th of 18 children.  His father's name was Mwangi and his mother, Wanjiru, was one of several wives.  They belonged to the "Mbari - ya - Mugo" clan or the clan of Mugo which was an important point of reference in John's life.  His family was among the first in Gatundu to plant coffee.

John was a dependable child, fond of his father. He went to school at Kijabe Mission School and later Kagumo High School where his excellent grades opened the doors to Nairobi University.

Gichinga was converted at age 15, deeply influenced by the example of his godly mother.  The East African Revival broke out a year later and laid the spiritual foundation for his future ministry. He became the chairman of the Christian Union in high school and later, a committee member at the University. He was influenced by University professor Stephen Niel in the department of Religious Studies.

When Gichinga graduated from the University in 1974 with a B.A in Education he felt called to full-time ministry. He joined the Fellowship of Christian Unions (FOCUS) and served as General Secretary for nine years, overseeing eight countries in East and Central Africa.  From 1986 to 1987 he attended London Bible College and between 1989 and 1990 he studied Hebrew and Greek at the Nairobi International School of Theology. Recently, John and his wife earned an M.A. in Christian Psychology from Wheaton Graduate School in Chicago, Illinois.

In 1985 Gichinga became pastor of Nairobi Baptist Church and was ordained the same year. He started a Young Adults Fellowship which has been an inspiration to many other churches in Nairobi.  He and his wife Emmy have a very active counseling ministry in the church. Nairobi Baptist Church has more than five thousand people in attendance each Sunday and new sister churches have been started all over Nairobi.

In 1995, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association invited Gichinga to speak at a World Mission Conference in Puerto Rico. He has published several articles in evangelical magazines. He has conducted workshops on Aids and is an outspoken critic of social evils.
