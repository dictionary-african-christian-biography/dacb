Daniel William Alexander was native of South Africa, consecrated on September 11, 1927 to be Archbishop and Primate of the African Orthodox Church in South Africa. In 1929 he licensed Spartas as a lay-reader in Uganda. In 1931 he visited Uganda, where he spent ten months training ordinands. In 1935 he visited Kenya at the request of the Kikuyu Independent Independent Schools (KISA) Association and ordained at least four priests. Of these, two formed the African Orthodox Church, while the rest remained faithful to KISA and formed the African Independent Pentecostal Church. These churches in Uganda and Kenya eventually transferred their allegiance to the Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria.
