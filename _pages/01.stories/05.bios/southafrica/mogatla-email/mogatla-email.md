> Ba re ke MaNape a Tshukudu E naka le nthla E tlhabang e itlhabela. Koko Mmakgabi's son Bethuel, my grandfather,  married Abelinah Matibola Mahuma (born 1889) in the early. When Kgosi Lebone was inaugurated in 1956 my mother Dikgomo (1923-2009) told me that she was there. My grandfather, Tedie Mahuma, Abelinah's brother,  e ne e le Kgosana ya kwa Mogajane and he also attended. As is the custom the people of Mogajane brought a cow as did other villages. He collapsed and died in my mother's) presence during the inauguration. This episode is known up to today at Phokeng.

> You list the other name for David Modibane as Mogatla. It is more likely to be Mokgatla. The Modibane surname has it roots in Mochudi in Botswana. Like many Batsawa, two Modibane brothers came to South Africa. They were from the Bakgatla tribe in Botswana, which is still a strong tribe in Botswana today. "Mokgatla"  is a singular term of "Bakgatla". In African culture it is common for a man to bear the name of his tribe.
