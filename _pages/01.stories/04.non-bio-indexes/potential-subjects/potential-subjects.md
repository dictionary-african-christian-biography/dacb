The following indexes contain potential DACB subjects, both Africans and missionaries, listed here for reference, to inform and encourage future research.  

**How to use these pages:**  

1\. Consult these pages if you wish to write a biography for the DACB and are searching for ideas of people whose biographies do not yet appear in the DACB. If a name is listed and does not show a link in the column next to the name, then the DACB doesn't have a biography on that person. A link will lead to a DACB biography.  

2\. Consult these pages in order to avoid writing a duplicate biography by checking to see whether the DACB has a biography on a specific person.
