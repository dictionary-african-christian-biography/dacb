        <p>John  Muswabuzi was the first modern native African theologian in the 19th century missionary movement that started in the mid-1850s. He was born around 1886 in Bikira, Masaka,  Uganda to Mr. Kibulassozzi and Mrs. Ermentina.[1] He joined the  seminary at Kisubi in 1901 and was among the first minor seminarians in 1902  when Bukalasa Minor Seminary was opened. He enrolled in the major seminary in order  to study philosophy and theology at Bikira in 1905. He then moved with the  major seminary when it was transferred to Bukalasa. Later he entered Katigondo  Major Seminary in 1911, finishing in 1913. Upon his ordination as a deacon in  1913, Muswabuzi was the third Katigondonian to be ordained a deacon. That same  year, his older brothers were ordained as priests.[2] Following his ordination  as a deacon, Muswabuzi was immediately posted to Bukalasa Minor Seminary to  teach. After a third year of probation he was ordained a priest on March 7,  1915 in Katigondo Chapel.[3] Notably, Muswabuzi was the very first priest to be  ordained at Katigondo Hill, giving him a special place in the history of Katigondo  National Major Seminary.</p>

<p>Muswabuzi was both the first modern African  theologian and a Ugandan liberation theologian. He developed an indigenous  theology for the liberation of the local clergy from the clutches of those  trapped by cynicism, pessimism, narrow-mindedness, legalism, parochialism, paternalism,  discrimination, fear, and domination. He was eloquent and fluent in Latin. At Bukalasa Minor Seminary, Muswabuzi was  a good instructor and taught students with great zeal, love, and prudence. He was  a man of great valor as he defended many of his students against accusations  brought against them by staff members. For example, he ably defended Joseph  Kiwanuka (later to become the first African bishop) when he was about to be  dismissed because the staff considered him too sickly.</p>

<p>According to the testimony of Fr. Ddiba and Msgr. Timoteo Ssemwogerere, Muswabuzi did a lot of writing   but much  of his work was destroyed out of neglect or out of fear of his writings. Muswabuzi  loved and defended African culture. He generated many new proverbs which he  recorded in the book called <em>Engero  Ensonge</em> (Self-critical Perceiving Proverbs). His book of proverbs was used  for a long time to teach children and adults the Luganda language. In fact he started  his own printing press and funded it himself because he was convinced that  printing and publishing were crucial to the development of African thought and  theology. He had come to realize that many of the works by African scholars at  the time were either not published or were being excessively edited to fit into  the mindset of western scholars. Muswabuzi considered this to be a form of  domination that was not helpful in the promotion of the creation of true  African thought. Thus, he named his printing press “Liberatum,” seeking to show  that publication should be used as a tool of liberation and development.</p>

<p>One of Muswabuzi’s greatest achievements  was his struggle for the equality of the <em>bafaza</em> (local clergy) with <em>abapere</em> (foreign  missionaries). The first priests Katigondo produced received excellent training  and education but this did not guarantee their equality with the  missionaries.[5] Muswabuzi made it clear to the missionaries that the local  clergy and the missionaries received the same valid priesthood and that there was no  need  to differentiate between them based on the color of their skin. They were  all brothers and all had the capacity to effectively lead the church and and  help it prosper. Furthermore, Muswabuzi was not afraid to destroy those elements  that seemed to create a difference between the local clergy and the  missionaries. At Bikira he once broke all the cups, glasses, and plates because  they were used to separate the priests and to threaten their brotherhood. He  vehemently opposed the superiority complex of the missionaries and rejected their  haughty attitudes in the use of petty features, such as beards, as a symbol of their  authority. Even though the local clergy were forbidden from growing a beard, he  grew his beard in protest. When he was reprimanded by his superiors he  questioned them on the hidden meaning of the beard and its value for the  priesthood. When no satisfactory answer was given, they dropped the issue of  the beard. He had the habit of stroking his beard as he talked to the missionaries the  way they did with the local clergy.</p>

<p>Muswabuzi fought the good fight. With  time both missionaries and local clergy came to recognize their true fraternity,  which they had to embody for the good of their mission. This realization was largely  the work of Muswabuzi who some considered crazy because of the prophetic signs  that he encountered as he fought for the liberation of the African clergy—signs  that equal treatment and mutual respect between missionaries and indigenous  clergy were becoming a visible reality among the clergy. In this, he long  anticipated the demands of great letters of Pope Benedict XV, <em>Maximum Illud</em> and Pope John XXIII, <em>Princes pastorem, *regarding the local  clergy</em>.*</p>

<p>Muswabuzi  developed a local theology in which he tried to explain fundamental church  concepts. For example, he called the church <em>ssere</em> (black jack) in order to express its catholic attribute: <em>Klezia Katolika eringa essere kubanga etulikidde ensi yonna,</em> (the  Catholic Church like black jack has burst, spreading all over the world). He  explained the indelible mark of ordination using  the image of distilled banana wine and the banana wine itself: *Nga walagi bwatasobola kuddamu kufuuka  mwenge, bye kityo n’omusaserdooti nga amaze okufuna obwafaaza tayinza kuddayo  kuba muntu wabulijjo *(once one has been ordained a priest, he can never  return to the lay state for he remains a priest forever).</p>

<p>Muswabuzi  fought for the self-reliance of the local churches and insisted that local  Christians must develop the capacity to support themselves and church programs.  He invested heavily in teaching them how to work diligently and productively.  In all the parishes in which he was posted, Muswabuzi struggled to make them  centers of both evangelization and development. In Bukalasa, Bumangi, Narozari,  Bigada, Bikira, Bukulula, Kitovu, Kyamaganda, Villa Maria he is known to have  been a man of great creativity, initiative, and a promoter of self-reliance and  development.[8] In Bukalasa Minor seminary, he established a large garden of  vegetables and an orchard to improve the diet of staff and students. In  Narozali, together with fellow priests, he created a road through the bush to  join the main road at Kabuwoko. Finally, Muswabuzi bought land in Bukakata and  starting planting trees that would provide material for making paper for his  printing press.</p>

<p>Muswabuzi  was a capable preacher and teacher. He gave beautiful inspiring homilies and  taught in many schools with a kind of clarity that is impossible to describe.  In this way, he inspired many young people to take up the priestly life and to  love education. He fought illiteracy and ignorance through many of his writings,  which unfortunately were lost.[9] He was a strict disciplinarian who instilled  in many of those he interacted with a sense of responsibility and a love for  justice and equity. He was a brave and dedicated pastor as Emmanuel Cardinal  Wamala observed, “I saw Fr. John Muswabuzi and the other first priests Victor  Mukasa and Bazilio Lumu. As a boy I admired them especially as they celebrated mass.  They covered large territories of their parishes. They were brave, they could  stay in villages for days administering sacraments, counseling, and instructing  people.”[10]</p>

<p>Muswabuzi taught that a priest after long years of service is entitled to  retirement and pension. He argued that if there are no systems in place to  achieve this, priests must learn to generate wealth through proper and  acceptable means and save some money for their old age. In order to show this  properly, he built his own home at Kyassonko in Masaka and there he stayed as  an old man, occasionally helping out in Kyamaganda parish as his energy would  allow.This was Muswabuzi’s final legacy, for he died on December 23, 1968 and  was buried at Bukalasa Cemetery. With his death, the modern African diocesan  clergy as well as modern African theologians received a powerful ancestor in  his person. He was the second to get this title of ancestor after Fr. Bazilio  Lumu.</p>
