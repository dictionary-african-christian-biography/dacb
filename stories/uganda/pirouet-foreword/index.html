        <p>It has been in preparation over a number of years, and the  selection of topics for inclusion has proved extremely difficult. The longer  one spends on a work of this sort, the longer grows the list of topics one  wishes to include. But in view of the amount of research needed for each, one  has to call a halt, since in the present situation, which is characterized by a  lack of textbooks and teaching materials, the most pressing need is for some  information to be circulated, and this Dictionary has been held up long enough.  It is certain that every user will have complaints about omissions. The only  answer I have to give to these complaints is that my own list of the topics I  should like to have included is probably longer than anyone else’s.</p>

<p>Since the Dictionary began to be prepared, both the Catholic  and Anglican Churches in Uganda have several times altered their dioceses, and  some reflection of this will be found here. It is hoped that cross-referencing  will adequately cover the present situation.</p>

<p>Some mention must be made of the sources on which the  information here is based.</p>

<p>The information about Anglican clergy has been checked with <strong>A  Register of Missionaries and Native Clergy, 1805-1905</strong> (published by the  C.M.S. for private circulation), and with the relevant <strong>issues of Crockford’s  Clerical Directory<em>.</em></strong> The dates of  ordination of Ugandan clergy have been checked with the Registers of Oaths and  Declarations taken by clergy on ordination for the Dioceses of Eastern  Equatorial Africa and Uganda.</p>

<p>Much of the information on African Christian leaders,  Anglican and Catholic, derives from research undertaken in preparing a Ph.D.  thesis for the University of East Africa. It rests on information in the  Archives of the C.M.S.; from parish registers, account books and minutes books;  from a wide variety of printed sources; and from a large number of oral  interviews. This last has been checked with documentary material wherever  appropriate, and with other oral sources.</p>

<p>Material for the Catholic Church has been derived from the  sources mentioned below in the list of contributors to whom special thanks are  due; from printed and published sources; and from oral information. Wherever  appropriate, material has been checked with the <strong>Catholic Directory for  Eastern Africa</strong>, editions of 1965 and 1968/9.</p>

<p>The printed sources are too numerous to be listed here, but  may be found in <strong>A Bibliography of African Church History</strong>, circulated by  the Department of Religious Studies, and available on request.</p>

<p>In spite of careful checking it is inevitable that some  errors will have crept in, and the editor will be grateful if those who noticed  them will be kind enough to write and tell her.</p>

<p>Special mention must be made of a number of people who have  helped with a series of articles, or given facilities without which this work  could not have been done. Thanks are due to:</p>

Information  about institutions has normally been supplied by a member of staff of the  institution. A complete list of these contributors will be found at the end.  But for all errors, and for the point of view expressed, the editor alone is  responsible.</p>

<p>1862 The explorer, Speke, reached the source of the Nile.</p>

<p>1875 The explorer, H.M. Stanley, visited Kabaka Mutesa and  sent a letter to the “Daily Telegraph” asking for missionaries.</p>

<p>1877 Arrival of *Lt. Shergold Smith and C.T. Wilson of the  *Church Missionary Society, sent in response to Stanley’s letter.</p>

<p>1878 Smith and a third CMS missionary, O’Neill, were  murdered at Ukerewe. Wilson remained alone in Buganda until *A.M. Mackay joined  him at the end of the year.</p>

<p>1879 Arrival of *Pere Lourdel and *Br. Amans of the *White  Fathers Mission.</p>

<p>1880 The first three Catholic converts were baptized.</p>

<p>1882 The first Anglican converts were baptized. The White  Fathers temporarily withdrew to Usukuma because of Mutesa’s hostility.</p>

<p>1884 Kabaka Mutesa died and was succeeded by Mwanga. Uganda was  declared part of the Vicariate Apostolic of Victoria Nyanza under *Mgr.  Livinhac.</p>

<p>1885 Persecution was feared and the first Anglican Church  Council was appointed to carry on if the missionaries had to withdraw. *Bishop  Hannington was murdered. Joseph Mukasa Balikudembe became the first Catholic  martyr (v. Uganda Martyrs). The White Fathers returned at Mwanga’s request.</p>

<p>1886 Many martyrdoms took place (v. Uganda Martyrs).</p>

<p>1888-9 Mwanga’s plans to wipe out all Christians and Muslims  failed, and he was deposed by a Christian-Muslim coalition. The Muslims then  seized power. The Baganda Christians fled to Ankola, and the missionaries south  of L. Victoria. After the Christians had fought their way back to power, Mwanga  was reinstated, but the real power now lay in the hands of the Christian  revolutionaries. *Mgr. Livinhac became Superior General of the *White Fathers,  and was succeeded by *Bishop Hirth.</p>

Kabaka Mwanga  rose in arms against British rule, centering his rebellion on Buddu, from which  all missionaries had to flee. *Pilkington was killed in the Mutiny but had  completed the Luganda Bible. The Anglican *Diocese of Uganda was formed and  placed under *Bishop Tucker. *Dr. Cook arrived and started *Mengo Hospital. The  first CMS women missionaries arrived.</p>

<p>1898 The Omukama Kabarega was driven out of Bunyoro and  *Tomasi Semfuma accompanied Kitainbwa who was put in his place by the British.  A government station was established in Ankole.</p>

<p>1899 Firipo Bamulanzechi and Andereya Kwamya went as the  first Anglican evangelists to Ankole (v. Mbaguta). Kitaimbwa was baptized in  Bunyoro. Kabarega and Mwanga were captured with the aid of *Kakunguru, and  exiled. *Sr. Dorthèe and *Sr. Mechtilde arrived with the first White Sisters.</p>

<p>1900 The Uganda Agreement was signed. *Kakunguru settled  near Mbale with evangelists Banyamini and Andereya Batuladbudde.</p>

<p>1901 The Revs. *H. Clayton and *J.J. Willis started a CMS  mission in Ankole. *Fr. Laane and *Johana Kitagana. Started a Catholic mission  at Hoima. The first senior seminary was opened near Masaka and the first  regular training for catechists was begun at Rubaga.</p>

<p>1905 Anglican work in Kavirondo (then part of the *Diocese  of Uganda) was started by *Willis, and the first Banyoro Anglican teachers  reached South Lango at the request of Chief Odoro.</p>

<p>1906 *Kings College, Budo, and Maseno School, Kavirondo  founded. The first Anglican evangelists went to the Sudan.</p>
