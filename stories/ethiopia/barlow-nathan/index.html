        <p>Nathan  Barlow and his wife, Mrs. Doris Barlow, with their son and three daughters,  arrived in Ethiopia in 1945 to resume the former SIM (previously called Sudan  Interior Mission – now known as SIM – Serving In Mission) medical ministry in  Soddo. The SIM story in Wolaitta begins in 1928 when Dr. Thomas Lambie and  other missionaries arrived in Soddo and were given a large piece of land by <em>Dejazmatch Yegezu</em>, Governor of Wolaitta,  on the outskirts of Soddo, called Otona. A hospital was built at Otona and  functioned until April, 1937, when the Italians arrived in Soddo and evicted  all the missionaries, including Dr. Roberts. It was in 1946 that Dr. Barlow  reopened the Soddo hospital located at Otona.</p>

<p>Soon after Barlow’s arrival in Wolaitta,  he saw the need for an expanded rural medical programme, and he began  discussions with the Ethiopian Ministry of Health (MoH) about the possibility  of opening a training centre for rural medics. He then called the Wolaitta Kale  Heywet Church (WKHC) leaders together and proposed his plan of the training  centre for rural medics. These church leaders fully endorsed Barlow’s concept. It  was agreed that each of the eight districts (<em>Hospa Dana</em>) would select a designated number of capable men for  training. When full permission for such a programme was granted by the MoH, the  first class was admitted for a two-year training period. These graduates were  assigned back to their respective districts and operated rural clinics fully  approved by the Ethiopian MoH. Through this means, the local Wolaitta  population were able to receive adequate help for chronic illness such as  malaria, TB, dysentery, amoeba, typhus, etc. These health assistants were able  to refer severe medical cases to the Soddo SIM hospital.</p>

<p>The Soddo medical training programme  later was expanded to trainees beyond Wolaitta. Young men and women with  ability and who were holders of eighth grade pass certificates from  neighbouring KHC areas such as Kambatta, Hadiya, Timbaro, Qucha, Gofa, Gamo,  Sidama, etc. were also admitted. These MoH approved rural health medics made a  significant contribution to the work of the Gospel throughout southern  Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Barlow made another significant  contribution to Wolaitta by encouraging the construction of domestic stoves  made from stones and clay and elevated high enough to keep small sleeping  children from rolling into the fire. This was done to reduce the number of  child burn cases admitted to the Soddo hospital each year.</p>

<p>Barlow was very generous to the poor  who came for medical treatment. If these needy people came to the Soddo  hospital with a letter from a local WKHC elder affirming that they were indeed  poor, they were treated without cost.</p>

<p>Another very helpful programme that  Barlow initiated within Wolaitta and nearby provinces was baboon and hyena  poisoning. Baboons were multiplying very rapidly at the expense of the farmers’  gardens, especially corn crops. The hungry hyenas were preying upon the  farmers’ domestic animals. Barlow trained several exterminator teams who were  able to poison hundreds of these predators and thus brought relief to large  sectors of the rural population of southern Ethiopia.</p>

<p>Barlow was a keen promoter of  personal hygiene. He developed a community programme of deep-pit ventilated  latrines that was to eventually impact every Wolaitta household from the  disease-bearing flies.</p>

<p>And furthermore, in his old age in  1999, he left his comfortable retirement in California, USA, and together with  our own skilled surgeon, Dr. Kelmu Desta and well-known SIM surgeon, Dr. Harold  Adolph, launched the “Mossy Foot Project” in Wolaitta. This project brought  relief and healing to hundreds of patients afflicted with elephantiasis. This  programme was both curative, in that the doctors operated on the swollen feet,  removing excess swollen tissue, and also preventative, in that all Wolaitta  people were strongly encouraged to wear shoes. It was discovered that the  reason for contracting “mossy foot” was that small silicon particles, very prevalent  in the red earth of Wolaitta, would enter the pores of the feet. The only  long-term remedy to rid Wolaitta of elephantiasis was that all should, wear  shoes - children, men and women. For this reason Dr. Barlow established a small  shoe-making enterprise that provided employment of mossy-foot patients as well  as providing affordable footwear for the poor.</p>

<p>Dr. and Mrs. Barlow served in  Ethiopia from 1945 to 1977. Because all of the SIM medical work was  nationalized by the then Ethiopian communist government, they returned to  America. They were then in their mid-sixties. Rather than remain at home in  retirement, they served in a medical capacity in the following African  countries: Niger, Kenya, Zaire, and Central Africa Republic.</p>

<p>As it says in Luke 19:10, <em>For the Son of Man came seek and to save  what was lost.</em> Barlow came to Wolaitta because his love for the Wolaitta  people and his desire to see the lost come to salvation.</p>

<p>While  in Wolaitta, Barlow was involved in many other ministries. He helped the poor,  provided care and provision for the orphans, helped the blind and distributed  eyeglasses to the elderly, and provided housing for the poor. In addition, he treated  badly mutilated accident patients and constructed a special wing on the Soddo  Hospital for recovering elephantiasis patients. He also introduced fruit trees  and taught Wolaitta farmers how to graft various varieties.</p>

<p>In his untiring service in  developing Wolaitta to be a wholesome place to live, he was like an untiring  Old Testament prophet. In his early years he travelled by foot to outlying  clinics month in and month out, with the result that in his older years his  feet developed incurable sores.</p>

<p>Barlow was a man of God, clever  and wise, Christlike in his love for others, full of hope and patient in  suffering. He was a true prophet, who thought of others as better than himself.  He was a man of his word and did not change his mind in compromise. He was a  father not only to four of his own children, but he has given spiritual birth  to tens of thousands in Africa and also in America.</p>

<p>At this time, Barlow is in God’s house, in a  better place where there is no sickness of the body. And for this mercy we  greatly thank God. He is together with righteous people from all nations, from  all language groups, with the fathers and mothers of Wolaitta who have gone  before us. He is now with WKHC and SIM co-workers in the Gospel who have died. He  will be received with joy and gladness and will see his Saviour face to face. For  this we are comforted and thank God.</p>
