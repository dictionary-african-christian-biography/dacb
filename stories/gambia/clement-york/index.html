        <p>York  Clement was the first Gambian to be ordained as a Methodist minister. Though  illness cut his ministerial career short, he served the Methodist Church in the  Gambia for about one and half decade as a local preacher, a catechist, an  assistant missionary and an ordained minister.</p>

<p>Few particulars  about York Clement’s personal life are known. Clement was a Wolof, born around  1833 or 1834. It is possible that he was raised a Methodist for there are no indications  that he was a convert to Christianity or the Methodist tradition. He was  married, but there are no details about Mrs. Clement. She probably did not work  for the mission, as some of the wives of the first generation assistant  missionaries had done.[1]</p>

<p>Clement  began working for the Methodist Church as a young man. He seems to have served  as a local preacher and a catechist for some years, before he was sent to the  Wesleyan College in Sierra Leone for further training. This was probably before  or around 1860, when Clement was in his mid-twenties.[2] In 1862, while still  in Sierra Leone, he was recommended as an assistant minister on trial. The  Methodist Conference however rejected the proposal; the reasons for the refusal  are not known. The  chairman at the time, William West (1861-1865), nevertheless spoke  highly of him.[3]</p>

<p>Clement  seems to have returned to The Gambia in 1863, because the Methodist Conference  appointments list him as assistant missionary at MacCarthy Island for the years  1863-64.[4]  It is unclear when precisely  Clement was accepted as a ministerial candidate. The minutes of the Synod of  1866 record that the chairman Benjamin Tregaskis was not satisfied with  Clement’s study progress, but in a letter dated August 1867 Clement still  self-identifies as an assistant missionary.[5] By 1869 the Methodist Conference appointments  list him as "native minister," stationed at MacCarthy Island.[6]</p>

<p>Clement’s  ministerial training, like that of most of his Gambian colleagues in the early  days, consisted mainly of independent study and tutoring by senior colleagues. The  archives suggest that Clement had little interest in reading theology. Benjamin  Tregaskis repeatedly refused to admit Clement into full connection, because he  did not meet the academic requirements. Clement, he wrote, had been supplied  with books "but showed no sign of having read them." Never one to mince words, Tregaskis  charged him with "discreditable indolence and  unwarranted self-confidence." [8] The archival  material seems to suggest that Clement had other priorities than studying;  possibly he was just so caught up by parish work, that it left him little time  to study.[7] In 1868 Clement was ordered down from Georgetown to St. Mary’s to  study under the guidance of his British colleague Vetranio Tyas. As a result he  was received into full connection in 1869. The year 1869 however did not merely  bring the celebration of ordination for Clement. During the 1869-cholera  epidemic that scourged Bathurst and surroundings in the months of May and June,  killing about 25 percent of the population, he lost his father, his sister in  law, her husband and a servant, all on one and the same day. [8]</p>

<p>Clement’s  ministry ended tragically. In August 1874 Clement showed up in Bathurst, ill  and confused and behaving peculiarly and defiant. In November 1874 it came to  light that Clement had incurred debts. There were also allegations that Clement  had developed a drinking problem. A petition by some of the members, "pleading  leniency in view of his faithful service in the past," resulted in an  arrangement to pay off the debt by deducting monthly payments from his stipend;  Clement was given a fresh start.[9] A month later Clement was accused of and  confessed to adultery.[10] Even his closest companion and co-worker Dodgin, the  oldest church leader at MacCarthy, testified that "Clement was out of his mind"  and "talking al kind of foolish things."[11] After an investigation and a  physical check-up, Clement voluntarily resigned from the ministry in December  1874.[12] The doctor who had been consulted, diagnosed that Clement either had  a drinking problem or suffered from an enlargement of the brain.[13] In May  1875, less than six months after his resignation Clement died; the burial  register reads: "died from an enlargement of the brain."[14] Thus the life and  career of the first Gambian Methodist minister came abruptly to an end. Clement  was only 41 years old when he died.</p>

<p>Except  for a brief interlude in Barra, Clement seems to have served most of his time  in Georgetown where he endeavoured to revive the work at MacCarthy Island. The  liberated Africans who had formed the majority of the Methodist congregation in  Georgetown, had begun to move away; as a result also the West Indian regiment  and most of the British colonial officers stationed at MacCarthy Island were transferred  to the coast. In attempt to reach a new audience, Clement  began evangelising the villages on the mainland near MacCarthy, preaching Nyabantang,  Seca, Dormah, Sappo, Yarbutenda, Cantilicunda, Medina and Tankuar. He also stressed  the need for Bible translation in the vernaculars to enhance evangelization.[15]</p>

<p>Following up on Clement’s evangelization  work in and around MacCarthy, the Synod of 1877 decided to station catechists  in all the villages he visited.16] A combination of the unrest caused by the  Soninke Marabout wars, a lack of response to the gospel and the customary shortage  of funds eventually caused all these stations to be closed down one after  another; the catechists were recalled to Bathurst.</p>

<p>The  few letters of Clement that are still extant suggest that he was a socially and  politically engaged person.[17] In 1872 for example Clement clashed with  Benjamin Tanner, the manager of Georgetown Island and highest British  representative outside Bathurst, over the treatment of refugees. Tanner had  issued a ruling, that Muslims and Soninke refugees, displaced due to the  Soninke-Marabout wars, were prohibited from entering the island. Among the  refugees seeking political asylum on the island, was the rightful owner of MacCarthy  Island, the King of Kattaba. When Tanner refused the King of Kattaba and his  wives entrance to the island, Clement and another liberated African Methodist  Dodgin publicly protested, calling it "equal to murder." As a result the two  men were imprisoned. The swift and personal intervention of the powerful  chairman of the district, Benjamin Tregaskis, ensured their release and generated  an apology from Tanner and the Governor.[19] Also in earlier years Clement had  proven an advocate for refugees from the Soninke-Marabout war, petitioning for  second hand clothing, education and government protection to restore peace in  the war-torn area.[19]</p>

<p>From  the archival material it is a clear that Clement was a man who was actively  engaged in the social and political issues of his parish. His work among  refugees, his willingness to challenge the government (Tanner) over the right  of asylum, his views on the effects of the Soninke-Marabout wars and his  advocacy for the Liberated African community in Georgetown all suggest that  Clement was a man who shared the gospel by doing as much as by preaching. The remembrance  of his work is somewhat overshadowed by the tragic side-effects of his illness  during the last year of his life. Nevertheless he seemed to have been  appreciated as a minister and colleague. For a while in 1869 Clement was the  only minister serving in The Gambia and was supervising the work in The Gambia.  Tregaskis, a very demanding chairman, seemed to have had no objection to that. Also  the 1874 petition by parishioners to WMMS on his behalf and the  humane way in which a solution was sought and  found for Clement’s debts in 1874, seems to testify of affinity, consideration  and compassion for Clement.</p>

<p>Considering  that Clement starting working as a catechist for the Methodist Church around  1856 or 1857, Clement dedicated nearly half of his brief life to the advance of  the Methodist Church in the Gambia.</p>
