<p>James Bamidele  Akhigbe Kio was born on August 18, 1936 into the family of Pa Joel Akhirevbulu  Kio and Mama Christiana Idobowa Kio (nee Osayemen) at Ifon in Ondo State. He  was a native of Ujemen-Epkoma, Esan West Local Government in Edo State. He grew  up in his hometown with his parents and, for a short time, his grandmother.</p>

<p>Kio began his  primary education at the CMS Primary School, Iruekpen at the age of six. His father worked for years with the Forestry  Department, which took him across Western Nigeria and the mid-west.  Consequently, Kio went to school at Ijebu-Ode. He completed his primary  education at Ado-Ekiti at the Christ Apostolic Church primary School in 1954. He  belonged to the last generation of pupils to read standard six, as the Obafemi  Awolowo Government replaced standard with primary schools.</p>

<p>In 1952, he unexpectedly  came into contact with the Seventh-day Adventist faith when he was involved in  an accident while travelling to Lagos with one of his uncles, Mathias Osayemen.  They were rushed to the Seventh-day Adventist Hospital at Ile-Ife, in the Western  region, for medical attention. Fortunately Kio recovered quickly, having  sustained only minor injuries but his uncle had a fractured collar bone and  bruises. Kio nursed his uncle in the hospital. While he was taking care of his uncle,  a British missionary nurse, Sylval Turtill, and an American doctor, Nengel  Sherman, took an interest in him. They introduced him to the Seventh-day  Adventist faith, which laid the foundation for his exploration into Adventist  education.</p>

<p>Having become a  Seventh-day Adventist, Kio went to the Harding Modern School and then to Adventist  Teachers College in Ado-Ekiti. Due to his performance, he was advised to do the  General Certificate Examination. At this time he was nick-named ‘Gentleman  Kio’. Shortly before Nigerian independence, in 1959 he left for Ghana to attend  the Seventh-day Adventist Institution. Upon completing his time there, he became  convinced of his call to be a minister of the Gospel and began his ministry in  Lagos. In post-colonial 1961, he was admitted into the Adventist College of  West Africa where he completed part of his training in Theology. He undertook  the other part in England, where in 1965 he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in  Theology and History from Columbia Union College.</p>

<p>At the time that  Kio was completing his Bachelor’s degree in 1965, Ogbonna in Etsakoland (in  present day Edo State) was established. This was the place he returned to as a  pastor; as the first official Seventh-day Adventist missionary to the  territory. It is said that the <em>Church of  God in Christ Mennonite</em> at Ogbonna decided, in 1965, to make the Sabbath (Saturday) their day of  worship and that this decision brought about a mass conversion to the church’s  membership, aided by the missionary work of a veteran Seventh-day Adventist  pastor, Lazarus O. Osekete, and a lay-person, P. U. Oitoto. In consequence of  this, in January 1966, Kio was posted to this little village of Ogbonna where  there was neither electricity nor clean water. The village was said to be a  warm, cultured community of truth-loving people. Pastor Kio accepted the call  without hesitation and without attempting to lobby for a more comfortable  position despite coming from the United Kingdom. This was the attitude of a  servant called to, not hired for, the Lord’s service. He also demonstrated his  service-oriented spirit in leading the community there to build a church. Kio  and the church members worked as bricklayers and builders to build the church  together.</p>

<p>Five years after  his Bachelor’s Degree, Kio was awarded a Diploma in mass communication from the  University of Lagos. Thereafter, he served in various capacities: as a  chaplain, district and church pastor, and teacher in Lagos, Edo and Oyo States.  He served as Education Secretary in the West Nigeria Mission of the Seventh-day  Adventist Church from 1970 to1972. Between 1972 and 1973, he was a teacher at  the Adventist college of West Africa before going to the United States of  America. In 1973, he went to the  University of Houston, Texas, where he earned a Master’s Degree in Speech  Communication. In 1979, he received his Doctorate in Philosophy from the  University of Kansas in Speech Communication and Human Relations. In addition,  he became a member of the Speech Communication Association of America, the  International Communication Association, and the International Religious  Liberty Association.</p>

<p>While in the  United States of America, Kio worked briefly in corporate communication for an  oil corporation in Houston, Texas. Shortly afterwards, he moved into academia. At  one time, he served as an instructor at Tulane University, New Orleans and  later, from 1979 to 1980, as an assistant professor at the University of  Minnesota.</p>

<p>From 1980 to1990  he served the church as the director for communication, youth and education at  the Nigeria Union Mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Lagos. Less  than a year afterwards, he was moved to the African Indian Ocean divisional  office of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Abidjan where he served as the director  of communications, public affairs and religious liberty. At the same time, he  worked as a visiting lecturer to several Adventist higher institutions across Africa.  From 1990 to 1998 Kio served as a pioneer director of the Ellen G. White Seventh-day  Adventist Research Center in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Kio served as the  last president of the church in Edo-Delta Mission and led the mission with  devotion towards conference status, which was gained at the end of his tenure  from 1998 to 2004. His tenure was marked by the most radical and ceaseless  approach to missions and church planting in the history of the church in this  area. His drive for mission and stewardship laid the foundation for the recent  growths in Edo and Delta Conferences. It is a point of note that during his  tenure he gave special attention to the celebration of baptisms at the workers’  monthly meetings, while expressing dissatisfaction with workers who did not  participate in them. However, he would only ever encourage these workers,  humorously saying that God has promised that desert-like places shall blossom.  In the end, he urged people to keep doing great things for the Lord. He had a  passionate burden for souls.</p>

<p>There is evidence  that following his purposeful drive towards church planting, there were  twenty-nine newly established churches across the Edo and Delta fields. Among  these were Otor-Iyede, Ibuso, Ugbokodo, Evboriaria, Otokutu and Useh. Thus, the  greatest Seventh-day Adventist church planting activity recorded in this area  to date took place under the influence of Kio’s emphasis on mission driven  projects.</p>

<p>Upon his  retirement, he accepted a call to serve at Babcock University where he earned  his Professorship and worked in the mass communication department until 2010. As  a teacher and scholar in the mass communication department at Babcock  University, Kio was a pioneer. He was outstanding in both his contribution and  leadership. By any definition he was a true original; he was also described as  a consummate scholar. After this period, he dedicated himself to a life of  spiritual growth, physical exercise with his wife, and visits to his children until  he died on June 16, 2014 at the age of seventy-seven. He was blessed with  lovely children and grandchildren.</p>
