<p>Lazarus Osekete was born into a  polygamous family of Pa and Mrs. Osekete in around 1915 in his hometown of  Obiaruku in Ukwuani Local Government Area, Delta State. He married Lydia  Osekete (nee Aswai). He grew up with his parents in his hometown of Obiaruku.</p>

<p>He had the standard schooling and  basic education that was, in the pre-colonial era, a minimum prerequisite to  teach in a primary school. While he was a professional teacher, he came into  contact with the Seventh-day Adventist faith at Warri in Delta State.</p>

<p>In 1956, Osekete was one of the foremost ministers  of the Seventh-day Adventist church in the area of what are now the Edo and  Delta Conferences. He was converted to the Adventist Church through the work of  the first official missionary to the Delta region, which was in what was then the  mid-western region; through Pastor E. E. Onumegbu who was sent from the East  Nigeria Mission. Osekete was called into  the ministry in 1956. From 1956 to 1961, he worked under the East Nigeria  Mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Nigeria. Two years after  Nigerian independence the West African Union Mission, under Pastor Welch,  transferred him to what was then West Nigeria Mission whose headquarters were  in Ibadan, Oyo State. At his request, he was stationed in the present Delta  State. In the pre-colonial era, the Delta region was operating under what was  then the East Nigeria Mission.</p>

<p>Osekete then worked at Bendel  Mission in very challenging circumstances in comparison to those of  twenty-first century ministers. His commitment to the mission could be  described as sacrificio-mission to the people of his generation. Simply put, he  was a missionary with little privilege and few pleasures who reached the people  of his day through a Christ-centered mission. Evidence suggests that in the  early part of his ministry he usually travelled on foot. It is told that he  once made his own way six kilometers or more from one village to another  because there was no reliable or readily available means of transportation. At  the time after Nigerian independence he travelled on foot between the churches  under his supervision, for example from Alalgeya to Ekapamre<em>,</em> and from Orhorokpe to Agharho. These journeys were not made on modern roads but on bush  roads, which were considered dangerous even though the people in the villages  at that time, the 1960s, were not hostile. If Osekete needed to cross a river,  he went by canoe. He would then get out of the canoe and continue the journey on  foot. If he caught a lift with a vehicle, he would alight at a particular point  and trek along a path through the bush to look for a bicycle to continue with  his journey to the villages of the churches he pastored.</p>

<p>Before Nigerian independence, the  church paid him four pounds. About a decade later, when the country experienced  what was called <em>Udoji</em>, 1972 to be  precise, his salary rose to ten pounds. This did not really make any difference  to his standard of living. The irony is that historically, whenever there has  been an increase in salary, there has been an increase in the cost of living.  Thus, the standard of living has not changed. However, even though his wage was  not high due to his level of education, he never had any cause to complain.</p>

<p>In the 1970s, the idea of progress began to  surface in Bendel Mission (which is now the Edo and Delta Conferences). Osekete  was entitled to a motorcycle which he rode across Bendel State (now split into  the states of Edo and Delta) to preach and to supervise the churches of that  area. To aid his ministry the East Nigeria Mission also gave him a PA system  for evangelistic campaigns.</p>

<p>This one particular enterprise  made the work of transmitting the Seventh-day Adventist beliefs and the "Three  Angels’ Messages" to the indigenous and non-indigenous people residing in his  mission stations easier and more appealing. As Osekete explained it, a minister  with this PA system would find singing and preaching easy. In this way they  drew people to come and listen to the messages in their public campaigns  between 1948 and 1961.</p>

<p>Osekete will be remembered for  being the first person to give the maximum number of years to ministry in what  are now the Edo and Delta conferences. To be precise, he gave over forty years  of service before and after retirement. Additionally, when he was the minister  in the area, he had given a remarkably wise and effective bible study at a  village called Ogbonna, in the present Edo State, which led to the conversion  of a denomination to the Seventh-day Adventist faith. He was the first  Seventh-day Adventist to come from his home town of Obiaruku, in about 1950. He  was also one of the first three converts to the Seventh-day Adventist faith in  the present Delta State.</p>

<p>Osekete was a victim of one of  the unfortunate, common problems faced by the early workers in the Seventh-day  Adventist Church. This was the lack of a retirement housing plan. He retired to  a rented apartment in his hometown, Obiaruku, Delta State. It was recorded that  he owned an inherited landed property from his father, which he received many  years after his father’s death.
Pastor Osekete can never be  forgotten for his spirit of commitment, mission-oriented selflessness,  Bible-based teachings, his faithfulness to the Seventh-day Adventist  fundamental beliefs and the <em>Spirit of  Prophecy</em> and his overwhelming gifts of visitation. Even though he said that  it was very challenging growing up, working as a minister and successfully  taking care of his home till retirement, he felt fulfilled at the end of it. He  was able to maximize the level of his education in the ministry. At the age of  about ninety-five, after official retirement, he still kept the flame of the  Gospel at heart; persistently planning new strategies towards membership  growth, particularly for his home church at Obiaruku, until February 4, 2010 when  he was peacefully called to sleep in the Lord.</p>
