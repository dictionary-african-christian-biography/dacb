<p>Johannes  Rebmann was a pioneer Protestant missionary to the East African coast from 1846  to 1875. During these years he never travelled further afield than Cairo. Although the 17th  century Portuguese church was still standing in Mombasa when he arrived, it was used as a  cowshed by Indian traders and no remnant of a Christian congregation remained. Fort Jesus  and its chapel were in the hands of Muslim rulers.</p>

<p>Rebmann was  born in the peaceful kingdom   of Wurttemberg, where  concern for religious scruples extended to exemption from military service. His  family were Lutherans. One of his uncles was a missionary in India. His  people cultivated vineyards. Johannes inclined to the Pietist section of the  church. From the age of 19 to 24 he studied in Switzerland at the Basler Mission  Seminary. As well as theology, evangelism and biblical languages, the students  learned English. The Mission had a  representative in London  working closely with the evangelical Anglican Missionary Society, which had  more locations for work than they could immediately staff. So in 1844 Rebmann  made his way up to the Rhine and across the Channel – the first sight of the  sea – to undertake training at the CMS Institute in Islington, North London. Within two years he was examined and  admitted to Anglican orders as deacon and priest. He was posted to Mombasa, where his fellow countryman, Ludwig Krapf, had  started work two years before, after previous experience in Ethiopia, and  lost his wife and infant daughter to malaria.</p>

<p>Rebmann was  escorted to the train which would carry him to Southampton, where a passage had  been booked for him on a sailing ship to Cape    Town. The voyage took eleven weeks. Finding the helper  who was supposed to meet him away, he had to arrange his own passage into the  Indian Ocean as far as Zanzibar.  Here the Sultan received him warmly and allowed him to travel on one of his own  vessels to Mombasa   Island. Krapf had long  been awaiting him, and installed him in the apartment beside the harbour where  the Governor had allotted some rooms to the mission. Their purpose was to  establish a station on the mainland. Through trading relations between the  Miji-kenda, nine related communities inland, and the Muslim Swahili, Krapf  secured a plot close to the heartland of the Rabai people. The two men, despite  attacks of fever, managed to reach the site, build rudimentary houses, extend  their language skills and become familiar with the norms of Rabai life. They  knew almost nothing of the peoples and terrain of the hinterland. Krapf had a  grand vision of a chain of mission stations stretching right across Africa, but  the geographers in Europe scoffed at his  account of a snowy peak close to the Equator. His accounts of diplomacy and  hierarchy among the powerful chiefs of the area were less noticed. He travelled  with porters bearing the mandatory gifts but without a tent or a weapon. He  carried an umbrella. He brought back and translated the earliest recorded  prayer of African Traditional Religion in the region: “Keep this stranger on  his way that he may see nothing harmful, be not kept back by thorn nor long  grass, encounter no elephants, rhinoceros nor enemies … May this man come again  so that we may meet and rejoice.”</p>

<p>In 1848  another German speaker, Jakob Erhardt, joined them at Rabai, a survivor of many  recruits who offered but were laid low on the way. Krapf’s first convert was  Mringe, a thoughtful crippled young man, and Rebmann had the privilege of  baptising him when near to death in Krapf’s absence.</p>

<p>Krapf made  a trip to Europe to publicise the mission  work, and the two younger men began to question the appropriateness of their  location. It was close to the <em>kaya</em>,  the traditional source of religious authority where the elders had to be  deferred to. In contrast the trade route they followed whenever they walked  down to the Mombasa  ferry was used by people of different communities making their way to the  island for trade or government business. They therefore decided to construct a  pair of permanent cottages (still in use today) at a place they called  Kisulutini Crossroads. This is the township known as Rabai today, though Krapf  reserved the name for the old mission site where he continued to reside. Like  many missionaries since, the young men failed to see how much their initiative  would disturb the senior man.</p>

<p>They  continued to gather information about the hinterland, questioning travellers  and collecting records of their own travels, and this led to the “Slug Map” of East Africa. It was not quite accurate, since they  supposed the great Rift Valley lakes  to be portions of a single inland sea, but it was a great advance on what was  known previously. The map and the safari reports were printed in the <em>CMS Intelligencer</em> and internal reports,  and incorporated in Krapf’s book, <em>Travels,  Researches and Missionary Labours</em> published in English in London in 1960. (The German version differs  slightly.) A facsimile edition was issued by Frank Cass &amp; Co. (London, 1968). Rebmann  does not seem to have been concerned about getting into print in his own name.  The daily routine of prayers, counselling and translation was his main focus.  Braving the humidity and insects, early word-lists and translations were sent  to Bombay for  printing. Only one of them appears under his name, jointly with Krapf’s, in the  1958 second edition of <em>A Linguistic  Bibliography of East Africa</em> edited by W. H. Whitely and E. A. Gutkind for  the East African Institute of Social Research at Makerere. It is <em>The Beginning of a Spelling Book of the Kinuka  Language accompanied by a translation of the Heidelberg Catechism</em>. Rebmann managed to  keep up correspondence with linguists in various parts of Africa  and to meet such scholars and interested agents as visited the coast, but never  himself sought to travel.</p>

<p>Krapf  arranged for Rebmann to enter into correspondence with the English widow, Emma  Tyler who was teaching in a Christian girls’ school in Cairo. She was ten years older than Rebmann  but might be a suitable wife for him under the restrictive conditions of  mission life. Late in 1851 he undertook the strenuous journey to Aden and Suez on a series  of Arab boats and then overland from Suez to Cairo. The agreement was  made and they were married by the British consul on 3 January 1852. The  hazardous return journey and the cramped quarters of Kisulutini must have been  trying to Mrs. Rebmann and the death of their only boy after just six days was  a crushing blow. But she continued to look after Rebmann and welcome guests  until her death in 1866. They made a brief visit to Egypt in 1856, when the political  turbulence threatened the continuance of the mission, but managed to keep it  going. Dr. Krapf had withdrawn from CMS in 1853, pleading ill-health, but  occasionally returned to the coast in other connections. The Rebmanns spent  some time in Zanzibar,  where there was a diplomatic community and one grocer’s shop. Faithful converts  kept the services going at Kisulutini.</p>

<p>It seemed a  brilliant idea of the CM HQ in London  to engage the “Bombay Africans” in evangelism. These were freed slaves who had  been educated at Nasik in India and could  be expected to be closer to African communities than their white  fellow-workers. But the idea had not been worked out in detail. The newcomers  originated from different parts of Africa and  were not conversant with the Swahili language or Miji-kenda customs. Some could  work as trained artisans, but of course they had no land rights and no immunity  to malaria. They were used to the same standard of living as the other  missionaries, but the Home Committee had not provided any allowance for them.  It was not easy for Rebmann to reconcile conflicts. He was technically “head of  station” but for many years had been on his own. His generation had never  expected fixed allowances or contracts of leave and service. Both the “Bombays”  and foreign visitors – now that steamships provided quicker travel and British India had superseded “the Company” – talked about  literacy and job opportunities rather than the prime evangelical concern with  individual salvation. Newcomers had a better, though still uncertain, chance of  survival. They were less dependent on local goodwill for transport and  supplies. They could afford a boat and the canvas safari equipment Rebmann had  marvelled at when he was called in to advise German explorers. There were still  risky times, when Muslim factions clashed, but not the delicate balance of a  single pioneer subject to the Sultan’s agents. The Methodist Mission at Ribe  and the UMCA in Zanzibar offered fellowship more  accessible than the Anglican diocese in far away Mauritius.</p>

<p>Rebmann was  desperately lonely after his wife’s death and his sight was impaired. Because  of his long service and the many fevers that had undermined his health, he was  seen as an old man, due to retire and make way for new initiatives. People did  not appreciate the long years of domestic applications that had nurtured a  strong, if small, local congregation. But he was only 53 when Sir Bartle Frere,  a former governor of Bombay,  burst upon the coast to advocate what seemed a “civilising” rather than  evangelising mission. It was right that more missionaries should be brought in  and new techniques applied. But some failed to recognise the hold of tradition  or the resonance of organisational change with the consolidation of Muslim  power on the mainland. The abolition of the slave trade, under British  pressure, had left many landless people looking for work. All this had an  affect on ordinary life.</p>

<p>As his  sight deteriorated further, and as political factions interfered more with the  security of mission stations, seen now rather as foreign enclaves than an  expressions of changing communal beliefs, Rebmann had to give in and allow  himself to be retired. From Mombasa he was  allowed to travel in a British naval vessel to Zanzibar,  where Christian and official communities saw him aboard a steamer to Aden, where he was to tranship for London. He was assisted by Isaac Nyondo, son  of his dearest friend Abe Gunga, and accompanied by Mr. Williams of CMS going  on sick leave. In London  he had discussions with CMS officials and underwent treatment which for a short  time improved his sight. Still accompanied by Isaac he travelled to his  childhood home, no longer the kingdom   of Wurttemberg but part  of the German empire. It all seemed very strange. Surviving relations welcomed  him, but he had been away more than 30 years and the way of life had changed.  Krapf was still a power in the church and the region, still dominant. Rebmann’s  sight was fading again and Isaac would soon have to return to London  on a training course before going back to Mombasa.  With some intervention from Krapf, a marriage was arranged between Rebmann and  a missionary widow, Luise Dauble Finckh who had served in India for many  years. Both partners must have bitterly missed the physical and social warmth  of their missionary years, but were able to combine their other resources for a  few months. Rebmann died in October 1876 and was buried under the inscription  “Safe in the arms of Jesus”.</p>

<p>He had  brought with him on shipboard a trunk full of his linguistic manuscripts and  nothing else. He left precise directions for its safekeeping, but was not able  to see it through the press. This task felt to Krapf. Dr. Steven Paas, author of the authoritative work on  Rebmann, <em>Johannes Rebmann: A Servant of  God in Africa before the Rise of Western Colonialism</em>, has gone into  painstaking detail to trace dates which may have been lost or wrongly  attributed. His bibliography is invaluable. Rebmann was gifted at working  alongside linguistic informants, notably Muslim scholars in Mombasa  and Zanzibar  but, like everything else he did, this was subordinate to the practical purpose  of evangelism. The Johannes Rebmann Foundation is based in Gerlingen, his  birth-place. My own novel on the life of Rebmann is not yet published.</p>
