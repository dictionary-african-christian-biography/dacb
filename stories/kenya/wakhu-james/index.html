<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>James Curtis Wakhu has been described by relatives, friends,  colleagues, teachers, church leaders, and fellow Christians as a radical  disciple of Christ and a missionary with exceptional qualities. His heart was  full of love for Christ and the unreached, especially Muslims. James Curtis  Wakhu lived a short life but one that was full of quality service to God and  humanity. There are many testimonies of his contribution to the wider church in  Kenya. Although Wakhu’s life was full of pain and physical challenges Christ’s  love compelled him to serve his generation in very unique ways. His deep  comprehension of the cross of Christ allowed him to endure pain for the gospel with  joy. Indeed, the saying that “it is not how long but how well,” is true of missionary  James Curtis Wakhu.</p>

<p><strong>His Family/Educational  Backgrounds and His Contribution to Kenya’s Development</strong></p>

<p>James Curtis Wahku, otherwise known by relatives and friends  as Jimmy or JC was born on April 27, 1967. He was the fifth born child to  Fanuel Makungu and Christine Aluso Wakhu of Elukari village, Khwisero Division,  Butere/Mumias District in Western Kenya. He  started his formal schooling in 1973 at St. George’s  Primary School, Nairobi. He sat for his Certificate of  Primary Education (CPE) examinations in 1979 and passed with distinction. He  scored three A’s with 36 points – a rare achievement in those days. His  excellent performance earned him a place at the highly regarded Lenana (High)  School in Nairobi.<a href="#">[1] </a>  His exceptional academic prowess did not stop  at the primary school level but continued the rest of his academic life. No  wonder, George Renner, one of Wakhu’s professors at the Nairobi Evangelical  Graduate School of Theology (NEGST) described him as a “brilliant and extremely  inquisitive young man.”<a href="#">[2] </a></p>

<p>Wakhu also excelled in sports. At Lenana, he distinguished  himself as an excellent athlete beginning in Form One. At the end of his very  first term at Lenana, and his school’s first annual swimming gala, Wakhu became  the junior breaststroke champion and earned his full house colors.<a href="#">[3] </a> Over time at Lenana, Wakhu excelled in swimming, soccer, basketball and rugby. He  represented the school at various levels of competition earning full swimming  and rugby colors (an award for distinguished achievement).<a href="#">[4] </a>  While Lenana School  is good in many sports, it is best known for rugby. So, as a typical Lenana  boy, rugby became Wakhu’s number one sport. Towards the end of his time there, Wakhu  was one of the best Lenana rugby players in his day.<a href="#">[5] </a></p>

<p>When on holiday, Wakhu played for Impala Rugby Football  Club. Even at the club level, he distinguished himself by winning various  awards including being declared the Most Valuable Player (MVP)in the 1985 Impala Floodlit Tournament.<a href="#">[6] </a> In  the final year of his schooling at Lenana, Wakhu was thrust into a number of  leadership roles because of his natural abilities and the respect he commanded  among his peers. In addition to being the Head of the School, he was also  captain of the school’s rugby team, which was the top ranked high school team in  Kenya at the time. Like other Heads of School before him, Wakhu also served as  the vice-chairman of the 6th Form society. James probably honed his  leadership skills thanks to these various experiences. In the end, James passed  his A-level examinations and began an undergraduate degree at the University of  Nairobi in 1987.<a href="#">[7] </a></p>

<p>During his studies in philosophy and sociology at the University  of Nairobi, James developed exceptional abilities for critical and analytical  thinking. With time, he became preoccupied with questions relating to his  existence and the purpose of his life. Whenever the opportunity presented  itself James would engage in lively debate on this issue with like-minded  people.<a href="#">[8] </a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Wakhu’s interest in rugby grew at the University  of Nairobi. He played for the university’s rugby team, the Mean Machine*, *in various competitions. He was later  invited to join the Kenyan national rugby team because of his outstanding performance. The highlight of his rugby  career was when he played for Kenya during the 4th All Africa Games  held in Kenya in 1987, earning a medal for his participation.<a href="#">[9] </a>  On October 22, 1990, Wakhu graduated with  Second Class Honour (Upper Division) in his Bachelor of Arts degree in  Philosophy and Sociology at the University of Nairobi.<a href="#">[10] </a></p>

<p><strong>His Conversion and Contribution  to the Mission  of God</strong></p>

<p>Wakhu’s life changed dramatically in 1984. He describes the  transformation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was born again in 1984 in my own  room through personal conviction of my own</p>

  <p>sinfulness and God’s gracious  kindness and patience with me. Knowing that sooner or later I was going to die,  I found no rest or peace in my heart concerning the condition in which I was to  meet him. Since I also did not know what the future held for me, whether joy or  sorrow, I urgently sought to be reconciled to the one in whose hand my future  lay and not wait until it was too late, or I was in unfortunate circumstances.<a href="#">[11] </a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wakhu’s conversion experience was the beginning of his rich  relationship with Christ. His love for Christ grew to such an extent that he  would not allow anything to stand  between him and Christ. His long time friend and classmate, Robert Mbugua,  confirms Wakhu’s deep spirituality and love for God when he describes how Wakhu  “gave up rugby as it was played on Sundays – the Lord’s Day.”<a href="#">[12]</a></p>

<p>After his conversion, Wakhu had a great passion to share Christ  with his team mates on the Mean Machine. In contrast with many Christians in  the university Christian Union (CU) who believed that “born again” people  should avoid social contact with non-Christians and formed exclusively  Christian groups, Wakhu determined to build strong relationships with the other  rugby players as a means of introducing them to Christ. He was often criticized  by some of the Christians because he took his meals with the Mean Machine  players. He socialized and lived with the athletes at the university. For Wakhu,  this was a vital aspect of his mission. He followed the example of Jesus by  living an “incarnational” lifestyle.<a href="#">[13] </a> George  Renner saw his deep love when he referred to Wakhu as a “radical disciple” of Jesus  Christ.<a href="#">[14] </a> Wakhu  further exhibited this love when he said:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>As I  continued to read the New Testament, it assured to me that the Apostles,</p>

  <p>especially Peter and Paul did not  have external riches but a knowledge of God as</p>

  <p>a friend that set them free and  filled them with unspeakable inner joy and</p>

  <p>conviction. The cry of my heart to  God became that he should take from me all</p>

  <p>that he wanted to, if only he would  give me what he gave them, the knowledge</p>

  <p>and the joy, the opportunity and  privilege of walking with him.<a href="#">[15]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Wakhu drew inspiration from the life of the Apostle Paul.  His love for Christ and those outside the fold of Christianity, especially  Muslims, grew tremendously. He was a man of prayer and deep spirituality.  According to Peter Mweu, “James was a very rare man and far apart to get in history.  My interactions with him showed that he was a man who was spiritually alive.  James was a man I found very easy to respect.”<a href="#">[16] </a> Wakhu’s  bosom friend, Curtis Reed voices a similar sentiment when he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early in  the morning, when I used to live in NEGST as his neighbor, I used</p>

  <p>to hear James from his room when praying.  James would start the prayers in English language, and then he would switch to  Kiswahili and later to Kiluyha. And these were very articulate, beautiful,  poetic and a heartfelt prayers that I had initially thought it was the radio  talking. It took me about two months to realize that it was James. He used to  wake up the same time everyday and he would just pour out his heart to God.  James prayed with great fluidity. His prayer life was simply uncommon at NEGST.  He had another presence in the inside of him and that was what made it  difficult for people to understand  him. He had a hard time being understood by many.<a href="#">[17] </a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Wakhu clearly understood God’s call over his life. He  clearly communicated this understanding  to anyone and was also willing to suffer for this conviction. Peter adds that,  “James exuded clarity of thought and precision in speech. He was a man who  could explain himself and the call of God over his life with the highest  clarity possible.”<a href="#">[18] </a>  Wakhu’s fellow rugby players and friends also  confirmed his great communication abilities even during his playing days.<a href="#">[19] </a></p>

<p>Wakhu worshipped at the Nairobi Pentecostal Church (NPC),  Valley Road, Nairobi, Kenya. Pastor Esther White, the wife of the NPC Valley  Road Senior Pastor, knew Wakhu for ten years and she praised his great  leadership capacity. According to Pastor White, Wakhu was active in the various  outreach ministries of the church especially in the areas of evangelism, hospital  visitation, and prayers. She added that Wakhu was a man of prayer who listened  to the voice of the Holy Spirit for direction.<a href="#">[20] </a></p>

<p>After his graduation from the University of Nairobi in 1990,  Wakhu’s love for Christ and for the unreached prompted him to take up a  difficult missionary call to Muslims in the northeastern and coastal areas of  Kenya. He joined the pioneer indigenous mission agency in Kenya known as Sheepfold  Ministriesled by Reverend Francis  Omondi. Wakhu served as the associate director and missionary in charge of the  mission team for Sheepfold Ministries from 1990 -1997. Francis Omondi,  described him as a good leader, a deeply spiritual person and one who was  always willing to learn.<a href="#">[21] </a> In  Wakhu’s own words, “As soon as I graduated from college, we left for Garissa  and settled amongst a tribe called the <em>Munyoyaya</em> for about one and half years after which the groups became bigger, having about  five missionaries. Later, I left for Lamu with the first group sent out from  Garissa.”<a href="#">[22] </a> While  in Lamu, Wakhu worked among the <em>Bajuni</em> people until 1997 when his health began to suffer.<a href="#">[23] </a></p>

<p>Wakhu came from a reputable family and he was raised by well  grounded parents who wanted the best for him. Naturally, his family found it  challenging to understand why a  promising university graduate would opt for a ministry in the “bush” instead of  taking up a job in the corporate world. So, his family was unhappy about his seven  years of ministry in northeastern Kenya. Wakhu himself did not know how to help  them see that what he was doing was more important than anything else.  </p>

<p>But Wakhu’s comprehension of the cross of Christ kept him  going. According to Curtis Reed, “James had a commitment to the cross of Christ  and he really understood it probably more than anyone that I have ever met. He  understood and believed that to be a follower of Christ you have to give your  life. And in reality, James literally gave his life to the cause of Christ.”<a href="#">[24] </a>  Reed adds that, “James believed no one could  have a Christian life without the cross.”<a href="#">[25] </a></p>

<p>Wakhu ministered in places where there weren’t any churches,  hospitals, schools or  other missionaries.  He went without the comfort of electricity, good water, telephone service, and  the Internet. According to Edwin Obuya, “James’ character can best be summed up  by the choices he made in life after graduating from the University of Nairobi  in 1990. He could well have chosen to join the corporate ranks or even  continued with his ministry work in the comforts of the big city.”<a href="#">[26] </a> Instead,  Wakhu chose to suffer for the cause of the gospel of Christ.</p>

<p>After much labor in the mission field Wakhu began to  experience health problems. In 1997, he decided to return to Nairobi in order  to get treatment. At this time, he felt the need to seek formal training for  ministry and he matriculated as a Master of Divinity student at NEGST in  September 1997. According George Renner, “having served in extremely difficult  areas in Kenya’s  northeast to evangelize Muslims; James came to NEGST broken and burned out.”<a href="#">[27] </a>  Wakhu’s health continued to fail while he was  at NEGST. He struggled with pain during his studies at NEGST and this made it  difficult for him to study as he wished.<a href="#">[28] </a> Several  visits to physicians yielded no results as they were unable to diagnose what  was really wrong with him. However, Wakhu endured these hardships while  continuing to study.  But when the pain  persisted he had to withdraw from his studies at NEGST only three weeks before  graduation. In his letter of temporary withdrawal to the registrar of NEGST, Wakhu  said:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am a final year student here at  NEGST undertaking a Master of Divinity degree. I have only eleven (credit)  hours before I graduate. However, due to serious health problems, I am at the  moment unable to continue with my studies. Having sought medical counsel, the doctors  advised me to postpone studies for a season. I have already sent you the  medical report. Kindly allow me to postpone the remaining hours of study to the  next academic year.<a href="#">[29] </a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Although he was in severe pain, Wakhu was full of hope that  he would return the following year to complete his studies. But sadly, on the evening  of Saturday, July 8, 2000, the very day he would have graduated at the NEGST,  James Curtis Wakhu was finally relieved of his pain when he was called to glory  by his Lord. His body was laid to rest on July 22, 2000.</p>

<p>Wakhu never married. It is possible that this reflected a  commitment to serve God without any “hindrances.”  </p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In the words of George Renner,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There were hundreds of people who  gathered at NPC Valley Road for a huge memorial service for James. It was a  mixture of celebration and deep sadness. I spoke on behalf of the NEGST  community. But the most powerful moment of the service was when an uncle of  James spoke. He was the family’s spokesman and his words shocked us all. He  expressed that he was publicly repenting on behalf of the family. They had  disowned James for being a fool as he went into missions and threw away all his  enormous potential for a “successful” life. But the uncle told us that the  family now realized the impact of his life. James’ life was the most significant  of any one among us.<a href="#">[30] </a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Wakhu enjoyed the grace of God but like any human being, he was  not perfect. He was a very spiritually sensitive person; maybe too sensitive.  That explains why some people found it hard to really understand him.<a href="#">[31] </a> Perhaps  that was the reason, according Esther White, that he experienced occasional  depression.<a href="#">[32] </a></p>

<p>In conclusion, the words of Peter Mweu best describe Wakhu’s  life: “I think James was the kind of man that shoots up within a very short  period of time and fades out the same way. But the shortness of time was not a  limitation for him to make a mark. I can say without any reservations that  James left a heritage in the Muslim evangelism and discipleship ministries of  the Church.”  For instance, Garissa, a predominantly Muslim community where  people were once very hostile to the gospel, now has more than twenty churches,  many schools, clinics, and missionaries. Sheepfold Ministries continues to be a  major mission agency in northeastern Kenya. This legacy is a testimony to the  sacrificial life and ministry lived by missionary James Curtis Wakhu. Although  James Curtis Wakhu is dead, his life speaks forever (Hebrew 11:4)!</p>
