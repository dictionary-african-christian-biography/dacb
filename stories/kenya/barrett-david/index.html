<p>David Brian  Barrett was born in Llandudno, Northern Wales, United Kingdom on August 30,  1927. As a child, he attended the Keble House School and Berkhamsted School. He  graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1945 with a Bachelor’s, and in  1952 with a Master’s, in Aeronautics. He worked at Britain’s Royal Aircraft  Establishment from 1948 to 1952 in aviation design, more specifically, as a  Scientific Officer and Aerodynamicist. He quit the air force upon re-assignment  to bomb design and entered the ministry of the Church of England. He received a  Bachelor of Divinity in 1954. He was ordained a deacon in that year and a  priest the following year in the Anglican Province of York.</p>

<p>From  1956–1957, Barrett attended the Church Missionary Society Missionary Training  College in Chislehurst, UK. Halfway  through the year, he felt a distinct  ministerial call to overseas missions, in particular, to reach the  “unevangelized millions” as described in a lecture by Bishop Stephen Neill.</p>

<p>In May 1957, Barrett was  assigned as a missionary to Kisii in Nyanza Province,  Kenya. His first introduction to African Christianity was confusion amidst  division. He immediately stepped into controversy—the largest Anglican schism  to date in Kenya was underway in Nyanza province. The Johera (“people of love”)  movement was on the brink of leaving the Anglican Church. Barrett received  conflicting information about the nature of his work in Kisii. CMS officials  encouraged him to live simply and develop personal relationships with  schismatic Africans. Diocesan officials in Kenya, however, compelled Barrett to  reinforce the Church’s authority and discipline regarding Africans leaving the  Church. Barrett sided with the CMS office and a newer style of missions.  Further, he sided with the new, growing African separatist movements against  the institutionalized, British, Anglican Church.</p>

<p>Work in Kisii  was lonely and isolated for Barrett. He spent mornings reading the Bible,  letters, missionary literature, and engaging in language study. In the  afternoons, he performed visitations and in the evenings attended meetings of  various kinds. He undertook a series of failed ministry efforts to reach  post-Christian African youth in the township. He had no progress winning them  back to belief in Jesus or implementing various kinds of Christian programming.  There was still a great separation between white Christians and what he called  “revival Christians”—Luo who followed indigenous African Christianity. After  two years of service, Barrett was disappointed that his only progress consisted  of building an inter-racial congregation of blacks and whites and successfully  working alongside African revival Christians. Barrett had difficulty persuading  revival Christians to accept any new teaching that looked anything like  European or Western Christianity because they were devoted to their indigenous  experiences of Jesus. Barrett’s missionary task was to overcome divisions  between the two groups because he saw revivalists as authentically Christian,  and even called them “brothers.” He stated, “We have found that God rewards  ‘colourblind’ co-operation richly.” Also at this time, the Anglican Church  moved in the direction of having all African nationals in the hierarchies of  overseas dioceses.</p>

<p>Barrett desired  to use his scientific training in missions. He lived in a remote area with  hardly any technology, a very different situation than his time at Clare  College and the British Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). Perhaps he was not  sufficiently challenged intellectually in his ministry, or he felt he had wasted  many years of scientific training. At the same time, however, his missionary  calling was to direct evangelization of unevangelized  people, which was not his task in Kisii. It did not appear that this calling  was satisfied in the slightest. These factors contributed to his desire for  further education after his initial service in Kisii. He felt theologically  inadequate for the future and contemplated furthering his education in  contemporary theology in the modern world. He  wrote to Bishop Stephen Neill: “After four years in an isolated pastoral  situation confined mainly to one small area, I feel I need to do something  entirely different for a time – to work in a stimulating team, to travel and  see something of the rest of the world church, to live a less leisuredly and  easy-going life than the Church here expects of us.” After 1961  Barrett’s ministry—indeed, his entire life—took a sharp turn toward his  eventual career in studying the science of mission and world evangelization.</p>

<p>Barrett took a leave from the CMS after his first missionary  tour ended in 1961. He attended Union Theological Seminary and Columbia  University and received a Ph.D. in Religion—which he studied sociologically—in  1965. His studies were a tremendous stimulus. He discovered, for the first  time, a relationship between his previous life in scientific work and his  desired missionary vocation: Columbia University called it “the social  scientific empirical study of religion.” In New York, Barrett discovered how  the apparently separate worlds of scientific research and Christian mission  could be related. In 1968, Barrett published his doctoral dissertation as *Schism and Renewal in Africa *(Oxford  University Press), which launched him onto the world stage as an expert in new  religious movements in Africa.</p>

<p>Although Barrett worked at the height of the secularization  narrative, in 1970 he estimated in the <em>International  Review of Mission *that Africa would be home to 350 million Christians by  the year 2000. In 1968, Kenneth Grub turned the popular *World Christian Handbook</em> over to Barrett. He produced the <em>World Christian Encyclopedia</em> (Oxford  University Press) after 13 years of research and travel to 212 of the world’s  223 countries. The <em>World Christian  Encyclopedia</em> was conceived, developed, and produced in Africa and utterly transformed modern understandings of world  Christianity. Unlike prior definitions of “world Christianity” framed in terms  of unity, Barrett’s research and travels revealed a world Christian movement  that was diverse, but highly fragmented.</p>

<p>Upon returning to Kenya in 1965, Barrett joined a team of  researchers supported by the World Council of Churches and the All Africa  Council of Churches for a project titled, “The Evangelization of West Africa  Today: A Survey Across 21 Nations and 150 Tribes.” He visited nearly every  country in Africa and began collecting massive amounts of data about African  religion, evangelization, Christian adherence, and tribal groups. Also in 1965,  Barrett became Research Secretary of the newly-founded Unit of Research of the  Church of the Province of Kenya. There were many tensions between the Unit and  the CPK that illustrated Barrett’s larger struggle as a British missionary who  sided with African independent movements. Barrett’s conflicts with the Unit demonstrated  tensions in Kenya between white missionaries and an African-led Anglican Church.  The core of the disagreement between Barrett and church leadership was the  focus of the Unit’s research: Barrett was decisively global-focused, whereas  the CPK wanted him to have a narrower, national focus. The CPK admired Barrett’s study of Anglicanism at the provincial and  national levels. However, when his  focus turned global, the nationalists in the Province interpreted Barrett’s  actions as a turn away from the CPK. The disconnect became stronger over time  and led to the Unit’s demise and Barrett’s departure from Kenya in 1985.</p>

<p>Barrett married Pam Stubley in 1972 and they had three  children: Claire Elizabeth (b. 1975), Luke John Paul (b. 1977), and Timothy  David (b. 1979). The Barrett family left Nairobi in 1985 for Richmond,  Virginia, USA.  Barrett was appointed a  Research Consultant for the Foreign (now International) Mission Board of the  Southern Baptist Convention, where he worked until 1993. He helped the board  re-orient their missionary sending toward unreached people groups around the  world.</p>

<p>Until his death in 2011, Barrett continued as an independent  researcher of world Christianity through the World Evangelization Research  Center in Richmond, and its later successor, the Center for the Study of Global  Christianity (established by Todd Johnson at Gordon-Conwell Theological  Seminary in South Hamilton, MA, USA in 2003). Barrett and Johnson produced the  second edition of the <em>World Christian  Encyclopedia</em> in 2001.</p>

<p>Barrett contributed to the development of world Christianity  as an academic discipline with the <em>World  Christian Encyclopedia</em> due to its copious statistical material. However, he  also provided a new, post-colonial intellectual framework within which to  understand the tremendous amount of change that occurred in global Christian  adherence since 1900. The <em>Encyclopedia</em> indicated that a new era of world Christianity had come, and its center of  gravity had moved from white Europe to black Africa.</p>
